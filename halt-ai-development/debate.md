# Motion

This house would pause the development of artificial general intelligence until robust safety frameworks are established.

## Definitions

- **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)**: AI systems capable of performing any intellectual task a human can, with autonomous goal-setting and cross-domain reasoning

- **Robust safety frameworks**: Verifiable technical and governance mechanisms ensuring AGI systems remain aligned with human values and under human control

## Scope

This debate concerns ALL frontier AI development by major labs and nation-states. It excludes narrow AI applications, academic research on safety, and theoretical work.
