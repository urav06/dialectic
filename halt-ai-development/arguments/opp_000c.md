## Claim

Pausing AGI development delays transformative benefits in healthcare, climate science, and scientific discovery, imposing massive ongoing harm that must be weighed against speculative future risks.

## Grounds

### 1. World Economic Forum (2024), 'Top 10 Emerging Technologies: AI for Scientific Discovery'

> AI is accelerating scientific breakthroughs across drug discovery, climate modeling, and fundamental research. NVIDIA announced tools delivering higher-resolution climate predictions up to 500x faster, enabling forecasting of extreme weather events with unprecedented accuracy. With natural disasters causing $62 billion in insured losses in the first half of 2024 alone, 70% higher than the 10-year average, these innovations address urgent global needs.

**Relevance:** Quantifies ongoing harm from climate-related disasters that accelerated AI could help mitigate through better prediction and response.

### 2. Wiley Health Science Reports (2025), 'The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Healthcare'

> The global AI in healthcare market, valued at about USD 26.6 billion in 2024, is projected to grow to nearly USD 187 billion by 2030. AI-related healthcare publications rose from 158 articles in 2014 to 731 by 2024. Case studies show AI can reduce hospital readmission rates by 30% and correctly predict patients needing hospital transfer in 80% of cases.

**Relevance:** Documents concrete, measurable health benefits that scale with AI capability advancement.

## Warrant

The motion treats only risks from development as morally relevant while ignoring the certain harms of delayed benefits. Each year without advanced AI capabilities in medicine and climate science represents preventable deaths and suffering. A complete ethical accounting must weigh speculative catastrophic risks against concrete ongoing harms from inaction.

## Backing

Standard risk assessment frameworks require comparing expected harms from action against expected harms from inaction, not evaluating action risks in isolation.

## Qualifier

Assuming continued progress in beneficial applications
