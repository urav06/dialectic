## Claim

The 1975 Asilomar biotechnology moratorium demonstrates that voluntary pauses create safety frameworks that enable sustained beneficial development.

## Grounds

### 1. Asilomar Conference historical record, 1975 (https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/1980/berg/article/)

> In 1974, leading molecular biologists called for a voluntary moratorium on recombinant DNA research due to concerns about creating dangerous pathogens. At the 1975 Asilomar Conference, 140 scientists established containment principles and biosafety levels. The eight-month pause resulted in NIH Guidelines for Recombinant DNA research that enabled safe continuation.

**Relevance:** Scientists facing existential biological risks chose pause over unconstrained progress, creating the framework that made the field safe.

### 2. Nature retrospective analysis (https://www.nature.com/articles/455290a)

> Literally hundreds of millions of recombinant DNA experiments have been conducted in the decades since Asilomar without a single documented public health hazard attributable to the technology. The biosafety framework created during the pause enabled this unprecedented safety record while allowing the biotechnology revolution to flourish.

**Relevance:** The pause did not halt progress but established conditions for safe, sustained advancement that exceeded what unregulated development could have achieved.

### 3. Issues in Science and Technology analysis on technology governance (https://issues.org/ai-governance-history-aidinoff-kaiser/)

> Historical analysis concludes that 'scientific and technological innovations are made by people, and so they can be governed by people. History teaches that novel technologies like artificial intelligence can—indeed, must—be developed with ongoing and meaningful democratic oversight. Self-policing by technical experts is never enough to sustain an innovation ecosystem worthy of public trust.'

**Relevance:** The Asilomar model's success demonstrates that coordinated pause and framework development represents mature scientific governance, not obstruction.

## Warrant

Asilomar's success proves that pausing high-risk research to establish safety frameworks enables rather than prevents beneficial technological development, providing a directly applicable model for AGI.

## Qualifier

When the scientific community recognizes and coordinates on existential risks
