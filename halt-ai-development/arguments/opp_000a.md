## Claim

A pause until 'robust safety frameworks are established' creates an indefinite moratorium because no objective, measurable criteria exist to determine when this condition is satisfied.

## Grounds

### 1. Kasirzadeh (2024), 'Measurement Challenges in AI Catastrophic Risk Governance and Safety Frameworks,' TechPolicy.Press

> Quantitative thresholds for defining catastrophic events raise important questions about methodology with no rigorous justification for specific criteria. The lack of rigorous justification in setting specific quantitative thresholds presents obstacles in reliably defining and measuring catastrophic events. Safety frameworks suffer from collective risk blindness, indirect causation oversight, ambiguous safety levels, unjustified thresholds, red-teaming limitations, and accountability gaps.

**Relevance:** Demonstrates that even experts cannot establish objective criteria for when safety frameworks become 'robust,' making the pause condition unfalsifiable.

### 2. GovAI (2024), 'A Grading Rubric for AI Safety Frameworks,' Oxford

> The criteria for evaluating AI safety frameworks are difficult to measure objectively. Many evaluation criteria rely on abstract concepts such as robustness, feasibility, and transparency. These concepts are difficult to measure precisely and objectively because it is difficult to quantify them. The lack of measurable indicators makes it challenging to evaluate some of the criteria.

**Relevance:** Confirms that 'robustness' itself lacks measurable indicators, rendering the motion's trigger condition inherently indeterminate.

## Warrant

Policy requiring satisfaction of unmeasurable conditions functions as prohibition rather than precaution. Without clear, falsifiable criteria for 'robust safety frameworks,' no development could ever legitimately resume, transforming a temporary pause into permanent prohibition by definitional fiat.

## Qualifier

In the absence of agreed metrics
