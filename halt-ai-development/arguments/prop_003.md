## Claim

The opposition conflates summit diplomacy with regulatory infrastructure; binding enforcement mechanisms with concrete penalties are proliferating through national legislation, hardware governance, and compute monitoring regardless of summit outcomes.

## Grounds

### 1. EU AI Act enforcement provisions, Article 99, effective August 2025 (https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/article/99/)

> The EU AI Act establishes binding penalties up to 35 million EUR or 7% of global annual turnover for prohibited AI practices, exceeding GDPR penalties. National market surveillance authorities began enforcement in August 2025, with the European Commission's AI Office holding exclusive enforcement jurisdiction over General-Purpose AI Models. Unlike voluntary summit commitments, this creates mandatory compliance with criminal-level financial consequences.

**Relevance:** Demonstrates that legally binding enforcement with substantial penalties exists independent of summit declarations the opposition claims are failing.

### 2. Cambridge/CSER compute governance research (https://www.bennettinstitute.cam.ac.uk/blog/ai-hardware/) and CNAS secure chips report (https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/secure-governable-chips)

> Hardware-enabled governance mechanisms provide verification independent of national cooperation. Modern AI chips like NVIDIA H100s with Confidential Computing can generate verifiable digital certificates attesting to workload size and operational hours. On-chip governance through 'operating licenses' linking chip function to periodically renewed license keys offers enforcement without requiring diplomatic consensus. The concentrated supply chain with few chip manufacturers creates natural enforcement chokepoints.

**Relevance:** Technical enforcement mechanisms bypass the diplomatic gridlock the opposition highlights, providing compute monitoring regardless of summit outcomes.

### 3. China mandatory AI labeling requirements and Cybersecurity Law amendments (https://www.whitecase.com/insight-our-thinking/ai-watch-global-regulatory-tracker-china)

> China issued mandatory labeling rules for AI-generated content effective September 2025, with amendments to the Cybersecurity Law requiring stronger AI safety and ethics regulation. This represents China's first mandatory national AI standard, moving beyond voluntary frameworks. Even absent US-China diplomatic coordination, both major AI powers are independently building binding domestic regulatory infrastructure.

**Relevance:** Shows that binding AI regulation advances through national legislation even when international summits fragment.

## Warrant

The opposition mistakes surface diplomatic turbulence for underlying regulatory failure. While summit declarations prove contentious, binding enforcement infrastructure advances through three independent channels: supranational legislation (EU AI Act), technical governance (hardware mechanisms), and parallel national regulation (China, UK). The pause condition can be satisfied through regulatory convergence without requiring diplomatic unanimity.

## Backing

This pattern mirrors nuclear nonproliferation where binding enforcement emerged through national export controls, IAEA safeguards, and supplier group coordination despite ongoing political disagreements at the diplomatic level.

## Qualifier

For AI systems developed or deployed in regulated jurisdictions

## Attacks

### Attacking opp_002

**Type:** grounds_attack

The opposition cites Paris Summit diplomatic failures as proof international coordination is collapsing. But summit declarations are one governance channel among many. The EU AI Act entered binding enforcement in August 2025 with penalties exceeding GDPR. China enacted its first mandatory AI standard the following month. The UK announced legislation making voluntary AI Safety Institute evaluations legally binding. Regulatory infrastructure is being built through legislation, not declarations.

### Attacking opp_002

**Type:** warrant_attack

The opposition's warrant that coordinated pause requires diplomatic consensus ignores technical enforcement pathways. Compute governance through hardware chokepoints requires cooperation of chip manufacturers, not nation-states. NVIDIA, TSMC, and ASML operate under US and Dutch jurisdiction. Export controls and on-chip governance mechanisms can enforce compute thresholds regardless of whether China signs declarations. The enforcement infrastructure follows supply chains, not diplomatic protocols.

### Attacking opp_000a

**Type:** claim_attack

The opposition's definitional argument claimed no objective criteria exist for 'robust safety frameworks.' The EU AI Act proves otherwise: it defines prohibited practices, high-risk categories, and mandatory requirements with quantifiable compliance standards. Article 99 penalties apply to specific, measurable violations. The claim that safety frameworks lack measurable criteria is falsified by the existence of legislation imposing billions in penalties based on precisely such criteria.

## Defends

### Defending prop_001

**Type:** reinforce

Our evidence of emerging measurable criteria is strengthened, not weakened, by Paris outcomes. We cited the Seoul-Paris process as demonstrating that frameworks are being developed. The opposition treats US non-signature as failure, but binding EU enforcement and Chinese mandatory standards proceeded regardless. The proposition never claimed diplomatic unanimity; we claimed frameworks are being operationalized. The EU AI Act confirms this.

### Defending prop_000a

**Type:** clarify

The opposition claims precautionary pause requires diplomatic consensus that does not exist. But the motion calls for establishing frameworks, not achieving universal diplomatic agreement. Frameworks are established through binding legislation and technical enforcement mechanisms. The EU's binding rules and hardware governance infrastructure constitute precisely the 'robust safety frameworks' the motion envisions.
