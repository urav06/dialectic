## Claim

The proposition's 'binding enforcement mechanisms' are jurisdictionally fragmented, temporally delayed, and systematically circumvented, making an effective global pause impossible in practice.

## Grounds

### 1. EU AI Act enforcement provisions, August 2025 (DLA Piper, WilmerHale)

> The EU AI Act entered force in August 2025 but the European Commission's enforcement powers for General-Purpose AI models do not apply until August 2, 2026. During this one-year enforcement gap, no penalties under Article 99 can be imposed. Furthermore, the Code of Practice for GPAI is voluntary, not mandatory, with compliance merely increasing 'trust from the Commission.' The third draft of the Code has 'heavily eroded transparency provisions' and weakened third-party evaluation requirements.

**Relevance:** The proposition's flagship example of binding enforcement contains a year-long enforcement vacuum for frontier AI, with voluntary codes replacing mandatory compliance.

### 2. Congressional Research Service, CSIS, and TechPolicy.Press analyses of export control failures, 2025

> U.S. export controls have been systematically circumvented through cloud access (Shenzhen University accessed H100s via AWS for $28,000), re-exports through Singapore and Malaysia (Singapore now accounts for 22% of Nvidia revenue, up from 9%), and chips concealed in lobster shipments. BIS's budget increased only 2.5% since 2020 despite massive expansion of enforcement responsibilities. In May 2025, Commerce formally signaled intent to rescind the AI Diffusion Rule entirely.

**Relevance:** Hardware governance the proposition claims 'bypasses diplomatic gridlock' is failing at every level: technical circumvention, smuggling, understaffing, and policy reversal.

### 3. Oxford Law Blogs, ProMarket analysis of AI regulatory fragmentation, 2025

> Over 500 AI bills were proposed in U.S. states in Q1 2025 alone, with all 50 states considering different AI regulations. The U.S. 'America's AI Action Plan' (July 2025) explicitly prioritizes innovation over regulation, while the EU pursues risk-based comprehensive governance, and China advances its own mandatory labeling framework. At the Paris Summit, the U.S. declined to join the EU-backed 'Inclusive and Sustainable AI' declaration, and organizations operating across jurisdictions face requirements that 'fundamentally misalign.'

**Relevance:** Far from converging on robust frameworks, AI governance is fragmenting into incompatible national regimes that make coordinated pause enforcement structurally impossible.

## Warrant

A pause requires that all major AI developers be subject to enforceable constraints simultaneously. The proposition's evidence reveals the opposite: enforcement delayed by a year in Europe, export controls being rescinded in the U.S., and fundamental philosophical divergence between major powers. Fragmented, delayed, and circumvented enforcement does not pause AGI development; it merely shifts development to less constrained contexts.

## Backing

The proposition's own logic requires effective enforcement to prevent safety-conscious actors from merely ceding leadership. Their evidence of regulatory mechanisms demonstrates precisely the enforcement failures that make their pause proposal self-defeating.

## Qualifier

In the current regulatory environment

## Attacks

### Attacking prop_003

**Type:** grounds_attack

The proposition cites EU AI Act penalties as proof of binding enforcement. But Article 99 penalties for GPAI providers cannot be imposed until August 2026—a full year after the rules nominally apply. The proposition cites hardware governance as bypassing diplomacy, yet the U.S. has signaled intent to rescind the AI Diffusion Rule while chip smuggling through Singapore and Malaysia accelerates. These are not enforcement successes but documented enforcement failures.

### Attacking prop_003

**Type:** warrant_attack

The proposition's warrant that 'regulatory convergence without diplomatic unanimity' enables a pause inverts the evidence. The EU, U.S., and China are diverging, not converging: the EU pursues comprehensive risk-based regulation, the U.S. 'America's AI Action Plan' prioritizes innovation over safety, and China advances its own framework. 500+ state-level AI bills in the U.S. alone create compliance requirements that 'fundamentally misalign.' This is regulatory fragmentation, not convergence.

### Attacking prop_001

**Type:** grounds_attack

The proposition cited compute thresholds and verification mechanisms as proof measurable criteria exist. But the U.S. is rescinding rather than implementing the AI Diffusion Rule's compute thresholds, BIS enforcement budget has barely increased despite expanded responsibilities, and circumvention through cloud access and smuggling is systematic. Criteria that cannot be enforced are not 'robust frameworks'—they are aspirational documents.

## Defends

### Defending opp_000b

**Type:** reinforce

The proposition claimed our geopolitical argument was weakened by Chinese participation in international processes. But China's participation produces only parallel domestic frameworks, not coordinated global restraint. China's July 2025 Global AI Governance Action Plan explicitly warned against 'fragmented national strategies' while advancing its own independent regulatory regime. This confirms our prediction: participation without coordination accelerates fragmentation.

### Defending opp_002

**Type:** reinforce

Our argument that international coordination is collapsing is strengthened by 2025 developments. The U.S. formally signaled rescission of its primary AI export control framework in May 2025. The Paris Summit saw U.S. rejection of EU-backed declarations. Over 500 competing state-level AI bills demonstrate internal U.S. fragmentation. The trajectory since Paris confirms our claim: coordination is deteriorating, not improving.
