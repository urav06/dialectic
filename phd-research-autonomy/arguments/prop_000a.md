## Claim

Students driven by personal passion for their research topic demonstrate significantly higher persistence and completion rates than those pursuing supervisor-determined topics.

## Grounds

### 1. Self-determination theory research on doctoral students (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361476X24000249)

> A study of 1060 PhD students using self-determination theory identified four motivation profiles: Low self-determined, Introjected, Identified, and High self-determined. The High self-determination profile, characterized by autonomous motivation driven by personal interest and values, showed the most desirable outcomes for persistence, satisfaction, and performance. Students with autonomous motivation expressed lower dropout intentions, while those with controlled motivation driven by external pressures showed poor outcomes including decreased well-being and higher attrition risk.

**Relevance:** This demonstrates that autonomous topic selection rooted in personal interest creates the psychological foundation necessary for PhD completion, while externally imposed topics undermine persistence.

### 2. Australian PhD completion data analysis (https://theconversation.com/phd-completion-an-evidence-based-guide-for-students-supervisors-and-universities-99650)

> From 2010-2016, only 65,101 of 437,030 students enrolled in Australian postgraduate research programs completed within six years. Research identified intrinsic motivation, specifically enjoying the research topic, as a key predictor of persistence and completion. Students who possessed genuine interest in their topic maintained momentum through the challenging dissertation process.

**Relevance:** In the Australian context specifically, personal connection to the research topic emerges as a critical factor distinguishing completers from the majority who do not finish.

### 3. Meta-analysis of doctoral persistence factors based on self-determination theory (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/349551560_All_You_Need_is_Self-Determination_Investigation_of_PhD_Students'_Motivation_Profiles_and_Their_Impact_on_the_Doctoral_Completion_Process)

> Research shows students' self-determined motivation, acting out of interest and curiosity rather than external control, is associated with higher academic well-being, persistence, and achievement. Competence satisfaction, strengthened by intrinsic motivation toward doctoral studies, emerged as a major determinant of doctoral persistence. Intention to persist was highest among students with globally satisfied psychological needs, which stems from autonomous topic choice.

**Relevance:** Following one's gut satisfies core psychological needs for autonomy and competence, creating the motivational resilience required to persist through the 4-year journey.

## Warrant

Since PhD completion requires sustained intrinsic motivation over four years, and since personal topic choice generates autonomous motivation while supervisor-imposed topics create controlled motivation, students who follow their gut will persist where others dropout.

## Backing

Self-determination theory establishes that human performance and persistence depend on satisfaction of innate psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Autonomous motivation satisfies these needs while controlled motivation frustrates them.

## Qualifier

particularly relevant given Australia's 85% non-completion rate
