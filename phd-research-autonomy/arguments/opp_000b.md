## Claim

Supervisors possess essential knowledge of research scope boundaries and resource constraints that students cannot access through intuition, making supervisor guidance necessary for viable topic selection.

## Grounds

### 1. Academic research on supervisor competencies, https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00131911.2024.2306938 and https://www.mdpi.com/2673-8392/3/1/4

> Research identifies domain knowledge as the first of five critical supervisor competencies for successful PhD supervision. Good supervisors help bound research topics both upwards and downwards - they know when ambitions are big enough to satisfy thesis requirements but also when they're becoming too large and hazardous to actually finishing. This boundary knowledge requires field expertise that supervisors possess and students lack.

**Relevance:** Supervisors have specialized knowledge about what constitutes an appropriately scoped PhD project, knowledge inaccessible to student intuition.

### 2. Australian PhD funding structures, https://www.findaphd.com/guides/phd-study-in-australia/funding and https://www.discoverphds.com/advice/funding/guide-to-australian-research-council-arc-phd-funding

> In Australia, PhD funding flows primarily through institutions and supervisors rather than directly to students. ARC funding goes to universities and research organizations supporting specific research projects, with universities using portions of grants to recruit PhD students for those projects. Research Training Program scholarships require university discretion. The quality and relevance of the supervisor's expertise is a major criterion for scholarship allocation. Many Australian PhDs, especially in STEM, are advertised as pre-funded projects.

**Relevance:** The funding architecture makes supervisor expertise essential for topic viability, as supervisors control access to resources necessary for project completion.

### 3. Research on PhD project feasibility assessment, https://academic.oup.com/rev/article/30/4/563/6406445

> Evidence of research mastery was cited more often by authors of successful approved proposals than unsuccessful ones. Successful proposals gave details of planned experiments, emphasized broad methodological and technical competence, and referenced preliminary scientific work. Feasibility assessment requires consideration of available resources including data, funds, time, equipment, and access to respondents or field sites.

**Relevance:** Determining project feasibility requires detailed knowledge of resources, methodology, and technical requirements that supervisors possess through field experience.

## Warrant

Topic viability depends on accurate assessment of resource availability, methodological requirements, and appropriate scope boundaries. Supervisors possess this institutional and disciplinary knowledge through years of field experience, while students cannot derive it from intuition.
