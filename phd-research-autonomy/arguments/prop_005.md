## Claim

Confirmation processes create institutional barriers preventing students from pivoting away from supervisor-influenced application topics, making initial gut-driven choice essential.

## Grounds

### 1. University of Sydney and Australian university research on candidature changes, https://www.sydney.edu.au/research/graduate-research/current-students/candidature/making-changes.html and https://researchvoyage.com/change-phd-research-topic/

> Australian universities require students seeking topic changes after enrollment to obtain supervisor approval as the first mandatory step, with supervisors initiating the administrative process. Substantial topic changes after confirmation require demonstrating the new topic remains feasible within remaining time, can be completed by maximum candidature duration, and has available resources. International students face 20 days to 4 months of approval processes including Department of Home Affairs clearance, with students prohibited from commencing new topics until formal approval. Universities explicitly warn that substantial topic changes affect progress, scholarship payments, and potentially student visas. If funding is tied to the original research proposal, changing topics requires funding body approval, which supervisors may object to.

**Relevance:** These institutional barriers make changing topics after enrollment administratively prohibitive, trapping students in application-stage topics requiring supervisor approval.

### 2. Academic research on sunk cost fallacy in doctoral research, https://skeining.wordpress.com/2011/05/17/the-phd-crisis/ and https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/anie.202208429

> Research identifies a pervasive sunk cost fallacy among PhD students: the belief that seeing projects through justifies having started the degree. Studies show researchers who start projects are more likely to continue because of sunk costs including time, effort, and emotional attachment. The optimism required to overcome PhD challenges simultaneously exacerbates the tendency to continue lines of inquiry when success likelihood is minimal. One third-year candidate wrote that the sunk cost effect impacted their decision to stick out graduate school despite questioning whether it was worth it. The months invested in confirmation-stage topic refinement create exactly the psychological trap preventing students from pivoting to gut-driven alternatives.

**Relevance:** Students who invest 6-12 months refining supervisor-influenced application topics during confirmation become psychologically trapped, unable to abandon that investment for genuine interests.

### 3. Research on confirmation panel independence and supervisor influence, https://sheffield.ac.uk/rpi/pgr/manage/confirmation-review and https://www.unsw.edu.au/content/dam/pdfs/governance/policy/2022-01-policies/progressreviewandconfirmationofresearchcandidaturesprocedure.pdf

> While confirmation panels must be independent from supervisors for impartiality, the confirmation process evaluates whether students have developed viable research programs from initial proposals. The review panel determines whether refined proposals should be approved or whether students should transfer to alternative programs. Supervisors are excluded from outcome decisions but students present topics already refined through months of supervisor collaboration. By confirmation, students have invested substantial time developing supervisor-influenced directions, with independent panels evaluating viability of those directions rather than facilitating pivots to student-preferred alternatives.

**Relevance:** Independent panels assess supervisor-influenced topics students have already developed, not whether students should pursue different gut-driven interests, making confirmation a validation mechanism rather than liberation opportunity.

## Warrant

When institutional processes require supervisor approval for topic changes, impose administrative barriers including visa implications, and occur after students have invested months developing supervisor-influenced directions creating sunk cost psychological traps, confirmation processes institutionalize topic lock-in rather than enabling the student autonomy the opposition claims, making initial gut-driven choice the only moment students can assert their genuine research interests before institutional mechanisms close that window.

## Attacks

### Attacking opp_004

**Type:** grounds_attack

The opposition claims confirmation processes allow topic evolution, but their own sources reveal topics must be 'loosely based on' application proposals and confirmation evaluates whether refined versions are viable, not whether students should pursue entirely different interests. University guidance emphasizes topic changes after confirmation face severe barriers: supervisor approval requirements, funding constraints, visa implications for international students, and scholarship jeopardy. One university explicitly notes confirmation panels may recommend students transfer to different programs if topics change substantially, threatening degree completion itself. The opposition presents confirmation as liberating when evidence shows it institutionalizes application-stage topics through refinement, not replacement.

### Attacking opp_004

**Type:** warrant_attack

The staged decision-making argument fails because stages create escalating commitment, not flexibility. Students spend 6-12 months refining supervisor-influenced application topics, then present those refined topics to panels evaluating viability. Research on sunk cost bias shows this investment psychologically traps students into continuing those directions even when alternatives better match their interests. The opposition's logic assumes students freely choose during confirmation, but institutional architecture creates the opposite: months of invested effort in supervisor-approved directions, administrative barriers requiring supervisor consent for changes, and financial penalties. Staged processes don't liberate students from premature commitment; they institutionalize it through incremental investment making abandonment increasingly costly.
