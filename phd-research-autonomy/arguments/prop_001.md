## Claim

Students uniquely know what genuinely fascinates them, an expertise inaccessible to supervisors that determines whether sustained engagement survives four years.

## Grounds

### 1. Chinese PhD research on academic passion and engagement (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11146691/)

> Academic passion significantly positively affects PhD students' research engagement through exploratory and exploitative learning pathways. Passionate students invest greater time and cognitive resources into their work. Critically, academic climate amplifies passion's effectiveness: in high academic climate environments, passion strengthens both exploratory learning (pursuing innovative knowledge boundaries) and exploitative learning (refining existing expertise). This demonstrates that passion isn't merely emotional preference but functions as behavioral fuel converting institutional support into productive scholarship.

**Relevance:** This shows passion operates as specialized knowledge about what drives one's own cognitive investment, expertise that supervisors cannot possess about students' internal states.

### 2. Nature 2025 PhD student survey (https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03229-8)

> PhD students who completed their degrees advise future candidates to trust their intuition about research interests: 'If you feel like you're not doing something you really love and truly believe in, abandon it. Trust your intuition. If you're on the wrong train, it's better to realize it as fast as possible.' Students emphasize making sure you're deeply interested in the process, not just the outcome, because genuine enjoyment of learning, problem-solving and digging deep into questions carries you through tough parts.

**Relevance:** Students who successfully completed PhDs identify trusting their own judgment about what they love as essential knowledge for navigating the doctoral journey.

### 3. Australian PhD expectation mismatch research (https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07294360.2021.1874887)

> Research surveying 114 PhD candidates and 52 supervisors in Australia found that personal expectations and research progress significantly and negatively influenced over 50% of candidates' mental wellbeing. Disagreement between PhD students and supervisors exists throughout PhD education, with students experiencing disagreements more often than supervisors acknowledged. As education progressed, students gained subject knowledge to the point where supervisors found themselves being 'outmaneuvered and outthought' by students, indicating a shift in expertise dynamics.

**Relevance:** Supervisors systematically underestimate the importance of students' personal investment in their topics, and the knowledge asymmetry that matters most shifts to the student over time.

## Warrant

Since passion determines sustained cognitive engagement and only students possess direct access to their own motivational states, students have irreplaceable expertise about which topics will sustain them through four years that supervisors cannot substitute through field knowledge.

## Backing

Epistemology establishes that first-person knowledge of one's mental states constitutes a distinct knowledge domain. No amount of external observation can substitute for introspective access to one's own motivations and interests.

## Attacks

### Attacking opp_000c

**Type:** grounds_attack

The opposition cites the same Australian completion data we presented in prop_000a, which explicitly identifies intrinsic motivation and enjoying the research topic as key predictors of completion. Their own source contradicts their claim: completion depends on personal interest in the topic, not supervisor topic selection. The evidence shows supervisor guidance on methodology matters for completion, but supervisor control over topic choice undermines the intrinsic motivation their own source identifies as essential.

### Attacking opp_000a

**Type:** warrant_attack

The Dunning-Kruger critique confuses two distinct domains of expertise. Students lack expertise in identifying research frontiers and methodological feasibility—domains where supervisors provide essential guidance. But students possess superior expertise in a different domain: knowing what genuinely fascinates them. This is first-person knowledge inaccessible to supervisors. The motion concerns topic choice, which primarily requires passion-expertise, not frontier-expertise. Supervisors can guide viable execution of student-chosen topics without controlling topic selection itself.
