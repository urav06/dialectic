## Claim

Confirmation panels only review supervisor-approved proposals, making panel independence structurally incapable of protecting student autonomy.

## Grounds

### 1. University of South Australia research proposal guidelines, https://i.unisa.edu.au/students/research-students/commencing-students/research-proposal-and-confirmation-of-candidature/

> Australian universities require supervisor approval before research proposals reach confirmation review. University of South Australia explicitly states: 'It is extremely important that supervisors provide input into the development of your research proposal.' The proposal development process requires students to 'work with your supervisors to complete a Research Induction Plan' and obtain 'approval by your supervisors' before submission to the Research Degree Coordinator. If proposals are not considered acceptable, they are returned to students who 'will have to make revisions in conjunction with your supervisor.' Without supervisor-approved proposals within maximum timeframes, candidature will be suspended, with students potentially required to apply for readmission.

**Relevance:** This establishes that supervisors function as mandatory gatekeepers whose approval students must secure before confirmation panels ever review topics, rendering panel independence moot.

### 2. Research on PhD student-supervisor topic dynamics, https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/education/articles/10.3389/feduc.2025.1570137/full and https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/194524/who-is-the-phd-student-to-their-supervisor

> Research on student-supervisor relationships reveals: 'Normally in this relationship, the seed of the idea for a research topic comes from the professor.' Students report that supervisors function as 'the central and most powerful person' who controls 'the topic and process of their dissertation research.' A number of doctoral students feel 'their research projects were largely controlled by supervisors who did not give them the freedom to choose their research topic.' When students want topics supervisors don't approve, their options are limited: 'Change your topic. Change your supervisor's mind. Change your supervisor.' Students cannot bypass supervisor approval to reach confirmation panels.

**Relevance:** This demonstrates that supervisor approval operates as topic control at the pre-confirmation stage when panels cannot intervene, making independence after supervisor filtering structurally inadequate.

### 3. PhD proposal development research, https://www.une.edu.au/about-une/faculty-of-humanities-arts-social-sciences-and-education/school-of-education/research/seminar-series/seminars-held-in-2018/how-to-write-a-research-proposal-that-meets-the-expectations-of-your-supervisors-and-admiration-of-the-phd-confirmation-panel

> Universities acknowledge research proposals must meet dual standards: expectations of supervisors and admiration of confirmation panels—in that order. Supervisors guide proposal development during the 6-12 month pre-confirmation period when students work 'in conjunction with supervisors' to transform initial ideas. Australian National University policy confirms proposals are 'always developed in conjunction with the candidate's supervisors,' with supervisory panels reporting on progress to ensure projects are 'not unduly influenced' by external factors, but no mechanism prevents supervisors themselves from exercising influence during collaborative development.

**Relevance:** Proposals reaching independent panels have already been shaped through months of supervisor collaboration, meaning panels review supervisor-influenced topics rather than providing student autonomy protection.

## Warrant

When supervisors control access to confirmation panels through mandatory proposal approval, and proposals are developed collaboratively over months embedding supervisor influence, panel independence cannot protect student topic autonomy because panels only review topics that have already passed supervisor gatekeeping.

## Backing

Institutional analysis establishes that procedural independence at later stages cannot remedy control exercised at earlier access-determining stages. Gatekeepers who control which options reach decision-makers effectively determine outcomes regardless of decision-maker independence.

## Attacks

### Attacking opp_005

**Type:** grounds_attack

The opposition claims independent confirmation panels prevent supervisor agenda capture, but their own sources reveal supervisors must approve proposals before panels review them. University of South Australia requires supervisor approval as a mandatory prerequisite for submission to confirmation review, with candidature suspended if students cannot secure it. The opposition presents panel independence as protection, but panels only see supervisor-approved topics developed through months of collaborative refinement. Independent review of supervisor-filtered proposals cannot protect student autonomy because the filtering happens before panels convene. The gatekeeping function the opposition celebrates operates precisely at the stage where panels cannot intervene.

### Attacking opp_005

**Type:** warrant_attack

The warrant assumes gatekeeping protects students from poor topic choices, but this conflates two distinct functions: viability assessment versus agenda control. Supervisors simultaneously assess feasibility and shape topics toward their research interests during the mandatory collaborative development period. Research confirms 'the seed of the idea for a research topic comes from the professor,' with students experiencing supervisor control over topic selection. The opposition's protective gatekeeping narrative obscures that supervisors exercise dual power: preventing students from pursuing gut-driven interests deemed unviable while steering students toward supervisor-beneficial topics. Independent panels reviewing supervisor-approved proposals cannot distinguish protection from imposition.

### Attacking opp_004

**Type:** grounds_attack

The opposition claims confirmation processes enable topic evolution from preliminary applications, but this confirms our position rather than contradicting it. Universities require proposals be 'developed in conjunction with supervisors' during the 6-12 month pre-confirmation period, with supervisor approval mandatory before panel review. This iterative refinement occurs under supervisor influence when students lack the expertise and institutional power to resist supervisor preferences. The opposition's own evidence shows confirmation reviews supervisor-approved evolved topics, not whether students should pursue fundamentally different gut-driven interests supervisors reject. Evolution under supervision embeds supervisor agenda rather than liberating student autonomy.
