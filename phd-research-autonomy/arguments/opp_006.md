## Claim

Students following gut instinct without supervisor guidance commit to fundamentally unviable topics that waste years before failure becomes apparent, while collaborative refinement provides early correction mechanisms preventing catastrophic investment.

## Grounds

### 1. Academia Stack Exchange community analysis and documented PhD failure cases, https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/156466/how-should-someone-choose-a-phd-topic-so-that-they-dont-fail and https://www.lexacademic.com/blog/it-happened-to-me-how-i-failed-my-phd-and-how-to-pass-yours-lex-academic-blog/

> A planetary physics PhD student chose their topic with starry eyes and high hopes—ambitious, perhaps too ambitious: solving a fundamental problem with a novel approach no-one had tried before. Their supervisor warned them to start smaller, but they were stubborn and naive. Trouble began in the second year when the project's scope overwhelmed them. Too many doctoral students end up with broad research topics, realizing too late they have bitten off way more than they could chew. One inexperienced researcher noted being wary of choosing their own topic due to complete inexperience and lack of knowledge. Identifying what is missing or what shortcomings exist in research is an important but challenging skill inexperienced researchers struggle to master.

**Relevance:** This demonstrates that gut-driven topic selection by inexperienced students systematically produces scope misjudgments that only become apparent after years of investment, when correction is impossible.

### 2. Research on doctoral supervision best practices and early intervention, https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2158244016659116 and https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00131911.2024.2306938

> Research on highly effective supervisors identifies warning signs they monitor: constantly changing topics or planned work, avoiding communication, isolating from peers, and avoiding submitting work for review. Best supervisory practices include encouraging students to start early on topics while discouraging topic changes, providing frequent meetings and targeted timely feedback. Supervisors encourage students to practice data collection and analysis early on a small scale when mistakes don't matter, giving quick feedback that makes huge differences long-term. Effective supervisors take hands-on roles at the start when students are new to methods and context, providing scaffolded support while allowing more independence toward the end.

**Relevance:** Supervisor involvement provides early-stage correction mechanisms that identify and prevent unviable topic commitments before students invest years, functioning as protective intervention rather than oppressive control.

### 3. Australian government regulations on international PhD topic changes, https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/ministerial-approval-changing-phd-topic-unworkable

> Australian federal government decisions require foreign postgraduates to obtain ministerial endorsement for changes to thesis topics, forbidding international students from altering study, thesis, or research topics without home affairs minister approval. Approval requires assessment that students are not likely to be a national security risk. UNSW Professor Nick Fisk noted about 2,000 overseas PhD students seek to change thesis topics annually for very genuine reasons: scarce resources, supervisor departure, or roadblocks in research. He warned this makes Australia a much less attractive destination for international students who underpin the country's higher degree research effort, particularly in science and technology.

**Relevance:** Topic change barriers affect students regardless of initial selection method, but students choosing unviable topics through gut instinct face these barriers after discovering fundamental flaws, while collaborative selection prevents commitment to doomed topics initially.

## Warrant

Since inexperienced students systematically misjudge topic scope and viability when following gut instinct alone, and since topic change barriers prevent correction after commitment regardless of selection method, gut-driven selection commits students to unviable topics they discover are doomed only after years of wasted effort, whereas collaborative refinement provides early correction mechanisms identifying fatal flaws before irreversible commitment occurs.

## Backing

Decision theory establishes that correction mechanisms have value proportional to the cost of error and inversely proportional to the delay before correction. When errors take years to manifest and correction costs include visa jeopardy and degree abandonment, early-stage expert review prevents catastrophically costly mistakes that post-commitment mechanisms cannot fix.

## Qualifier

particularly for international PhD students in Australia

## Attacks

### Attacking prop_005

**Type:** warrant_attack

The proposition claims confirmation creates lock-in through sunk costs, but this ignores the comparative analysis: what creates worse lock-in? Students who spend 6-12 months refining potentially viable supervisor-influenced topics can still pivot if independent panels identify fatal flaws. But students who commit to gut-driven unviable topics without expert input invest 2-3 years before discovering fundamental scope problems their inexperience prevented them from seeing. The documented PhD failure cases show students choosing ambitious topics their supervisors warned against, then discovering too late the projects were doomed. Confirmation sunk costs are 6-12 months; gut-driven failure sunk costs are 2-3 years discovering what expert review would have identified immediately.

### Attacking prop_003

**Type:** grounds_attack

The proposition claims applications require binding topic commitment before mastery, but this misses the key distinction: collaborative selection provides expert assessment preventing fundamentally unviable commitments, while gut-driven selection commits students to topics their inexperience cannot evaluate. The evidence shows students choosing topics with starry eyes, ignoring supervisor warnings, then failing years later when scope overwhelms them. Topic change barriers harm students equally regardless of initial selection method, but gut-driven students discover their topics are doomed after these barriers close, while collaborative students identify fatal flaws during confirmation when independent panels can still mandate changes or program transfers. The temporal paradox cuts both ways: if students lack mastery at application, gut instinct provides no protection against catastrophic misjudgment.
