## Claim

Students choosing topics through gut instinct face catastrophic lock-in when topics prove unviable, requiring supervisor changes that are more disruptive than initial collaborative selection.

## Grounds

### 1. SGSAH Blog research on PhD supervisor changes, https://sgsahblog.com/2024/12/23/switching-supervisors-in-the-middle-of-my-phd-project/

> Changing supervisors is described as one of the most difficult things a PhD student can go through within their project. One researcher spent two and half years fighting against supervisors and what she felt were the constraints of her discipline but were actually problems within her project. She realized she had to remove one of her supervisors if she was to finish her thesis. The process required many emails explaining why she wanted this change, a meeting with the head of department to discuss the impact, and three separate meetings to talk about the issue. She was told there might be difficulties arising from this change. With the current climate in academic institutions, being firm and making your own way through a PhD feels intimidating.

**Relevance:** When gut-driven topic choices prove incompatible with supervisor expertise, students face supervisor change trauma far worse than initial collaborative refinement would have been.

### 2. Research on Australian PhD topic and supervisor selection, https://australiaawardsvietnam.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Finding-a-Supervisor-Jan-2020.pdf and https://www.discoverphds.com/advice/international/phd-in-australia

> Australian academics are often very busy, and universities limit the number of PhD students any academic can supervise to keep workloads reasonable. It is sometimes difficult to find a supervisor prepared to commit to accepting students. The University of Melbourne requires that supervisors must endorse transfer applications before approval by heads of department and deans. If transfers mean new supervisor arrangements, students must discuss roles and responsibilities with new supervisory teams, essentially restarting the supervisory relationship.

**Relevance:** Supervisor scarcity means students who discover gut-chosen topics mismatch with supervisor expertise cannot easily switch supervisors, trapping them in unviable projects.

### 3. PhD completion research on passion versus feasibility, https://samvitmenon.medium.com/passion-phd-how-far-will-passion-get-you-in-your-phd-journey-ede2b587d57e and https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10734-024-01181-6

> Passion alone is insufficient for PhD success: students need mental strength, consistency, and persistence to keep going despite facing obstacles daily. Researchers report seeing passions fizzle out three months into PhD programs. One Australian graduate chose his research topic because of personal interest without considering whether it could bring about opportunities for an academic career, driven by love for research and idealistic perspective. Around thesis submission time, he failed to gain a postdoc position despite proactive measures, attributing this to limited publications from his passion-driven but poorly scoped topic choice.

**Relevance:** Gut-driven passion without feasibility assessment leads to topics that cannot sustain careers, discovered only after years of investment when correction requires supervisor changes.

## Warrant

When students choose topics through gut feeling without expert feasibility assessment, they commit to projects that may prove incompatible with supervisor expertise or career viability, requiring supervisor changes mid-candidature that are more traumatic and disruptive than collaborative topic refinement would have been initially, making gut-driven selection paradoxically create worse lock-in than the collaborative process the proposition rejects.

## Backing

Decision theory establishes that error correction costs increase with delay and commitment depth. Discovering topic-supervisor mismatches after years of investment forces students into supervisor change processes requiring institutional approval across multiple hierarchical levels, versus collaborative refinement during confirmation requiring only panel review of evolved proposals.

## Qualifier

particularly for international students and those in specialized fields

## Attacks

### Attacking prop_006

**Type:** warrant_attack

The gatekeeping critique assumes supervisors impose agendas, but supervisor approval serves a different function: ensuring supervisor-student topic compatibility preventing catastrophic mismatches. Research shows changing supervisors requires two and half years of fighting, multiple departmental meetings, and intimidating institutional navigation. Students choosing gut-driven topics incompatible with supervisor expertise face this trauma when mismatches emerge. Supervisor approval during proposal development prevents commitment to topics supervisors cannot adequately support, protecting students from the worse lock-in of mid-candidature supervisor changes. The proposition's model trades collaborative refinement for supervisor-change trauma.

### Attacking prop_005

**Type:** grounds_attack

The sunk cost argument fails comparative analysis. The opposition claims confirmation creates 6-12 month sunk costs trapping students in supervisor-influenced topics, but gut-driven selection creates far worse traps. Students who spend years pursuing passion-driven topics without feasibility assessment discover career-killing scope problems only when seeking postdoc positions, as documented in Australian research. At that point, correction requires not just topic pivots but supervisor changes described as one of the most difficult experiences possible, requiring departmental meetings and institutional approval. Confirmation sunk costs enable course correction through panel review; gut-driven sunk costs require supervisor-change trauma.
