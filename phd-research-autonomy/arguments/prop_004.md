## Claim

The opposition's collaborative ideal obscures that supervisors retain ultimate veto power over topic decisions, making student gut-driven choice essential for protecting autonomy.

## Grounds

### 1. Academia Stack Exchange community consensus on PhD research direction determination, https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/48821/how-is-a-research-direction-determined-between-a-graduate-student-and-their-advi

> Discussion of how research direction is determined reveals that while PhD students theoretically have final say over decisions, this operates within a spectrum from advisor-driven to student-driven approaches. Faculty acknowledge that students employed on funded grants face predetermined project constraints, and that advisors provide 'crucial guidance' that frames acceptable topics. One practitioner notes the continuous spectrum from advisors leaving students 'completely alone to decide' to advisors guiding 'step-by-step,' revealing that student autonomy exists only within advisor-approved frameworks rather than as genuine independent authority.

**Relevance:** This demonstrates that collaboration in practice means students can only choose topics their supervisors permit, not topics they autonomously select.

### 2. Higher Education research on power dynamics in doctoral advising, https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10734-023-00998-x

> Research examining 28 doctoral students' experiences identified multiple forms of power supervisors exercise: resource-based power, enabling or disabling power, perceptual power, relational power, and power as prerogative. Power operates at meso- and micro-levels often to students' detriment. While students exerted agency where possible, they faced severe power differentials. By fourth year, students described having 'autonomy in the lab' through social evaluation of lab context, indicating autonomy is granted permission rather than inherent right. Doctoral students encountered power inequities with adverse impacts throughout their advising relationships.

**Relevance:** Supervisors control whether students experience autonomy, making collaboration dependent on supervisory permission rather than structural equality that genuine collaboration requires.

### 3. Research on doctoral supervision models and student autonomy, https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03075079.2024.2408667

> Most supervisors perceive non-collaborative supervision as legitimate, wherein students assume the primary role but supervisors function as gatekeepers, admitting students and providing guidelines in a command-and-control or top-down approach. Even when students have full autonomy to choose research subjects, methods, and data, supervisors retain gatekeeper authority. This reveals that even in models claiming to grant student autonomy, supervisors maintain structural control over whether student choices are acceptable, operating through admission decisions and guideline-setting power.

**Relevance:** The gatekeeper function means supervisors can block student topic choices regardless of collaborative rhetoric, requiring students to follow their gut as initial assertion before supervisors exercise veto.

## Warrant

When collaboration operates within power structures where one party retains veto authority while the other lacks equivalent power, the collaborative framework becomes a mechanism for legitimizing the dominant party's preferences rather than genuine joint decision-making, making pre-collaborative assertion of student preferences through gut-driven choice necessary to establish negotiating position.

## Backing

Political theory establishes that collaboration between unequal parties requires the subordinate party to first assert their interests before negotiation, because collaborative frameworks without prior position-taking allow dominant parties to define the acceptable range of options.

## Attacks

### Attacking opp_003

**Type:** warrant_attack

The opposition claims topic and methodology are inseparable, but this argument proves our position. If topic selection inherently embeds methodological commitments requiring supervisor expertise, and supervisors control methodology guidance, then supervisors effectively control topic selection through their methodological veto power. The opposition's own logic reveals that collaborative topic development gives supervisors final authority: students propose topics, but supervisors determine viability through methodological assessment. This transforms collaboration into supervisor decision-making with student input rather than genuine joint choice. Students must follow their gut to establish which topics they will fight for, because collaboration simply negotiates supervisor approval.

### Attacking opp_001

**Type:** grounds_attack

The opposition cites self-determination theory showing autonomy and guidance are complementary, claiming collaboration integrates both. But their source describes integration as 'tricky from an autonomy point of view,' acknowledging inherent tension. Research on doctoral power dynamics reveals supervisors exercise multiple forms of power including 'power as prerogative' and function as gatekeepers even in non-collaborative supervision models claiming student autonomy. The collaborative ideal assumes equal negotiating power, but supervision structures grant supervisors veto authority over topic viability. True autonomy requires students to follow their gut as primary input, with supervisors providing methodological guidance on student-chosen topics, not collaborative selection giving supervisors topic veto power.

## Defends

### Defending prop_002

**Type:** reinforce

The opposition attacks our power asymmetry argument by claiming it eliminates all supervision functions. This misses our distinction: we advocate supervisor guidance on methodology and scope refinement of student-chosen topics, not elimination of supervision. The evidence on power dynamics confirms supervisors function as gatekeepers who control whether student choices are acceptable. This gatekeeper power over topic selection requires students to assert gut-driven preferences first, establishing their position before entering collaboration where supervisors exercise veto authority. Methodology guidance operates differently because students have already committed to their topic, giving them negotiating power to resist methodological impositions while accepting expertise on execution.
