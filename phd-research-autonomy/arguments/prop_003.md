## Claim

PhD applications require topic commitment before students can develop mastery, making supervisor-guided selection a mechanism for imposing supervisor research agendas on vulnerable applicants.

## Grounds

### 1. Australian PhD application requirements (https://www.findaphd.com/guides/phd-study-in-australia/applications, https://study.uq.edu.au/stories/how-to-get-phd)

> Australian PhD applications require students to contact prospective supervisors and submit research proposals at least 4-6 months before starting, with universities refusing to consider international applications without prior supervisor contact. Students must choose topics and secure supervisor agreement 6-12 months in advance to allow for visa processing and scholarship applications. This application architecture forces topic commitment at the novice stage, precisely when the opposition claims students cannot know what will sustain their passion.

**Relevance:** This demonstrates topic selection happens before students have any opportunity to develop the mastery the opposition claims generates passion, exposing the temporal impossibility of their framework.

### 2. PMC research on supervisor conflicts of interest in topic selection (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2876133/)

> Research documents that supervisors systematically push students toward topics benefiting supervisor research agendas rather than student career development. Supervisors give biased advice on topic choice, steering students toward 'valuable, patentable discoveries for which the professor is more likely than the student to get credit' rather than topics producing publishable findings advancing student careers. Graduate students cannot easily change supervisors without jeopardizing completion, creating vulnerability to agenda capture at the application stage when students lack power to resist.

**Relevance:** When students must choose topics before developing mastery, supervisor guidance becomes a vector for imposing supervisor interests, not neutral facilitation of student passion development.

### 3. Times Higher Education documentation of supervisor topic control (https://www.timeshighereducation.com/features/monsters-and-mentors-phd-disasters-and-how-to-avoid-them)

> Doctoral students report supervisors 'so focused on his research that he tried to change my topic to fit in with his interests' and feeling 'research projects were largely controlled by supervisors who did not give them the freedom to choose their research topic.' Students describe supervisors advertising glamorous topics then providing 'precious little guidance,' obliging students to work with methods doing 'very little to enhance my career.' One student's PhD experience 'destroyed not only my career plans but also my passion for the subject, my ambition and my self-confidence.'

**Relevance:** Empirical testimony shows supervisor-guided topic selection systematically crushes rather than cultivates student passion, contradicting the opposition's mastery-development narrative.

## Warrant

Since Australian PhD applications require topic commitment before students can develop domain mastery, and since supervisors use this vulnerable moment to impose their research agendas, the opposition's mastery-first framework actually supports our position: students must protect their nascent interests through gut-driven choice because they will never get the mastery-development opportunity the opposition describes if supervisors capture their topics first.

## Backing

Temporal logic establishes that if X must occur before Y is possible, then X cannot depend on Y. Topic selection precedes PhD enrollment, which precedes mastery development. Therefore topic selection cannot depend on mastery.

## Attacks

### Attacking opp_002

**Type:** grounds_attack

The opposition cites research showing passion develops through mastery, but this creates a fatal temporal paradox. Australian PhD applications demand topic commitment 6-12 months before enrollment, when students are definitionally novices. The opposition's own framework admits students lack mastery at this stage. If students cannot choose topics without mastery, and PhD programs require topic choice before providing mastery opportunities, then students following the opposition's logic would be paralyzed into inaction. The evidence inadvertently proves our position: since the system forces premature choice, students must trust their gut as the only available guide, because supervisor guidance at this vulnerable stage systematically serves supervisor interests, not student passion development.

### Attacking opp_002

**Type:** warrant_attack

The warrant claims students lack epistemic access to future passion states, but this assumes supervisor access is superior. Supervisors have zero epistemic access to student internal states at any temporal point. The opposition's mastery framework actually undermines their position: if passion emerges through engagement with material, then initial gut feelings about what draws one's curiosity provide the essential starting direction. Supervisors cannot know which topics will generate student passion through mastery because that depends on individual cognitive and emotional responses inaccessible to external observers. The student's gut represents their best available information about their own interest trajectory.

## Defends

### Defending prop_001

**Type:** reinforce

The opposition attacks our passion-expertise distinction, but their own mastery evidence supports us. We never claimed students know what they will be passionate about after developing mastery. We claim students know what currently fascinates them enough to sustain the initial commitment required to develop mastery. The Nature survey we cited quotes successful completers: 'make sure you're deeply interested in the process, not just the outcome' and 'if you're not doing something you really love, abandon it.' These students describe present-moment knowing about what drives them, not prediction of future states. This first-person knowledge of current motivational states is precisely the expertise supervisors cannot possess.
