## Claim

Research topics cannot be separated from methodological considerations, making the proposition's distinction between student-chosen topics and supervisor-guided methodology logically incoherent.

## Grounds

### 1. Research on research question formulation, https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6322175/

> The FINERMAPS framework establishes that good research questions must simultaneously satisfy feasibility, manageability, and appropriate methodology requirements. The research question determines study design: questions about disease incidence require surveys; questions about risk factors require case-control or cohort studies. Common failures include questions too broad or narrow, unmeasurable questions, and inappropriate scope—all requiring methodological expertise to identify. Stepwise development demands literature review, identifying information gaps, narrowing scope, and evaluating feasibility simultaneously.

**Relevance:** Topics embed methodological commitments at their core, making topic selection inseparable from methodology assessment requiring supervisor expertise.

### 2. Australian PhD topic evolution research, https://patthomson.net/2017/11/27/refining-your-research-topic-starting-the-phd/ and https://blogs.ed.ac.uk/research-bow/a-pocket-guide-to-first-year-annual-review/

> The primary task in the first months of Australian PhD candidacy is revisiting and refining the initial topic into a researchable project through reading. Universities acknowledge the metamorphosis researchers undergo: while interest areas may remain the same, problem statements, purpose, significance, research questions, and methodology evolve with academic maturity. Supervisors confirm it is natural and expected to have thought changes during the PhD process. The best first step is seeking supervisor advice.

**Relevance:** Initial gut topics systematically require transformation through supervisor-guided refinement, showing topic selection is an iterative expertise-requiring process, not a discrete moment.

### 3. Research on doctoral question development, https://www.imperial.ac.uk/morph-lab/notes/for-phd-students---how-to-formulate-a-research-question/ and https://www.phdthesis.in/developing-a-framework-for-evaluating-the-feasibility-of-a-phd-research-topic-in-computer-science/

> Formulating research questions is a core skill and key to original research, traditionally learned through one-to-one transmission between novice and senior researcher. Methodology must be based on the research question and available resources and expertise. Consulting supervisors is very important—experienced supervisors help polish your research question and method together. Methodology should be appropriate for the research question and feasible within resources, time, data, equipment, and expertise available.

**Relevance:** Supervisor expertise transforms initial ideas into answerable research questions with viable methodologies—not just implementing methods but formulating questions themselves.

## Warrant

If research questions inherently embed methodological commitments requiring expertise to assess, and initial topic ideas systematically require transformation into viable research questions through supervisor guidance, then distinguishing student topic autonomy from supervisor methodology guidance creates false separation of inseparable elements.

## Backing

Philosophy of science establishes that research questions are theory-laden and methodology-dependent. A question's formulation determines what counts as evidence, what methods can answer it, and whether it is tractable.

## Attacks

### Attacking prop_002

**Type:** warrant_attack

The power asymmetry argument proves too much. If structural hierarchy prevents collaborative topic selection, it equally prevents all supervision functions the proposition accepts. Their defense of prop_000b acknowledges supervisors should provide methodological guidance—but the same power dynamics would corrupt methodology collaboration. Australian doctoral supervision research shows power asymmetries can be effective when governed by expertise-based referent power, gradually shifting as students progress to mutually respectful mentorships. The proposition's logic eliminates all supervision as illegitimate imposition.

### Attacking prop_002

**Type:** grounds_attack

The cited evidence shows students deferring to supervisors describes problems when students abandon their interests, not when they receive viability guidance. The study states supervisors were outmaneuvered after students gained expertise—demonstrating supervision successfully developed capability. This supports collaborative refinement, not gut-driven selection. The proposition conflates students abandoning personally meaningful topics under pressure versus students transforming initial interests into viable questions through expertise. Only the former represents the problematic power dynamic their evidence describes.

## Defends

### Defending opp_001

**Type:** reinforce

The proposition's attack mischaracterizes our position. We don't claim supervisors impose topics against student interests. Rather, supervisor expertise transforms student interests into answerable research questions—a process topic evolution evidence confirms occurs for nearly all PhD candidates. The proposition's own source acknowledges integration happens within ideas and interests the student had. This is precisely our claim: collaboration integrates student passion with supervisor expertise to produce viable questions, not a binary choice.
