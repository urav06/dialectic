## Claim

The sustained cognitive engagement required for doctoral-level deep learning can only be maintained when students work on topics that genuinely fascinate them.

## Grounds

### 1. Educational psychology research on interest and deep learning (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-95294-2)

> A 2025 study in Scientific Reports analyzing 634 students found that individual interest, the trait component derived from personal experiences and values, is both the starting point for learning journeys and the driver for deep learning and continuous progress. Deep learning, which requires intrinsic motivation and involves cognitive commitment, relating ideas, and genuine understanding, depends on personal interest to sustain the mental investment necessary for thoughtful and persistent engagement.

**Relevance:** PhD research demands the deepest form of learning over an extended period, which cognitive science shows is impossible without personal interest driving sustained mental investment.

### 2. Research on doctoral student motivation and completion (https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/21582440221109586)

> Studies identify lack of interest as a demotivating factor preventing degree completion, with students struggling to find purpose in their PhD when the topic fails to resonate personally. Research shows that students' interest in their selected research topic personally influences their intrinsic motivation, which in turn determines whether students maintain the competency development necessary for doctoral work.

**Relevance:** Over a four-year doctoral program, topics lacking personal resonance create motivational erosion that leads to abandonment, while gut-driven topics sustain engagement.

### 3. Australian doctoral climate research (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228719523_Attrition_Completion_and_Completion_Times_of_PhD_Candidates)

> Research on Australian PhD programs found that research climate factors including the amount of freedom PhD candidates are granted to carry out their own project directly affects candidates' intention to quit. When supervisors forcibly require students to engage in the supervisor's research projects without respecting student scientific interests, this creates conflict stemming from students' feelings of lack of expression, undermining the subordinate communication environment needed for sustained doctoral work.

**Relevance:** In Australian doctoral contexts specifically, topic autonomy determines whether students experience the supportive climate necessary to sustain four years of intensive research.

## Warrant

Since doctoral research demands exceptional cognitive engagement sustained over four years, and since cognitive science demonstrates such engagement depends on personal interest rather than external obligation, only gut-driven topics provide sufficient motivational fuel for completion.

## Backing

Educational psychology establishes that deep learning approaches requiring analytical and conceptual thinking depend on intrinsic motivation, which external topic assignment cannot generate.
