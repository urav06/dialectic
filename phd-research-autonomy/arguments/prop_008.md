## Claim

Supervisors must approve proposals before confirmation panels review them, making panel independence structurally incapable of preventing supervisor agenda control.

## Grounds

### 1. Australian university confirmation requirements, https://i.unisa.edu.au/students/research-students/commencing-students/research-proposal-and-confirmation-of-candidature/ and https://www.ecu.edu.au/schools/engineering/research-activity/student-research-journey/confirmation-of-candidature

> Australian universities require supervisor approval as a mandatory prerequisite before research proposals reach confirmation panels. University of South Australia states proposals must receive approval by supervisors before submission to the Research Degree Coordinator. Edith Cowan University requires supervisors to be satisfied with the final document before submission to the Associate Dean for formal approval. University of Western Australia mandates that completion of confirmation tasks requires endorsement by the Coordinating Supervisor before Graduate Research Coordinator review. This sequential approval architecture means panels only review proposals supervisors have already approved.

**Relevance:** This demonstrates supervisor approval functions as a mandatory filter preventing proposals supervisors oppose from reaching supposedly independent panels, rendering panel independence structurally meaningless for protecting student autonomy.

### 2. Research on Australian PhD supervision trends, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S089083891930099X

> Research examining PhD supervision in Australian and New Zealand universities found both supervisors and students increasingly prefer structured approaches with more directive supervisory styles as a means of coping with rising student numbers while ensuring successful completions. These directive styles manifest through group supervision models with multiple students focusing on similar topics, aligning student research topics with supervisors' interests, and the dominance of certain research paradigms. The focus on journal publications as required contributions to knowledge addresses supervisors' performance outcomes but undermines diversity in research topics, limits the process of inquiry, and reduces student autonomy.

**Relevance:** This shows Australian supervisors are systematically becoming more controlling over topic selection to serve their own performance metrics, precisely the agenda capture our position identifies and which mandatory approval requirements enable.

### 3. Self-determination theory research on autonomy support versus control, https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/education/articles/10.3389/feduc.2023.1153647/full and https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283734096_Doctoral_Supervision_in_the_Light_of_the_Three_Types_of_Support_Promoted_in_Self-Determination_Theory

> Research applying self-determination theory to doctoral supervision identifies a thin line between structure and control, with intentions to offer structure easily turning into providing control in practice. Autonomy thwarting is positively linked to controlled motivation and negatively linked to autonomous motivation, while autonomous motivation predicts engagement, effort, and learning. When supervisors use controlling approaches, students experience autonomy frustration leading to demotivation oriented by fear of punishment or shame. In contrast, autonomy support predicts need satisfaction and autonomous motivation, with significant positive effects on performance and engagement.

**Relevance:** This establishes that supervisor control over topic approval creates autonomy thwarting that damages the exact motivational outcomes essential for PhD completion, contradicting the opposition's protective framing of gatekeeping.

## Warrant

When supervisors must approve proposals before independent panels review them, panel independence cannot protect student autonomy because supervisors filter which topics reach panels, and when Australian supervisors increasingly adopt directive styles aligning student topics with supervisor interests to serve supervisor performance metrics, mandatory approval requirements enable the exact agenda capture that autonomy-thwarting control produces.

## Backing

Institutional analysis establishes that gatekeepers who control access to decision-makers determine outcomes regardless of decision-maker independence. Sequential approval processes create structural dependency where later stages can only evaluate options earlier gatekeepers permit.

## Attacks

### Attacking opp_005

**Type:** grounds_attack

The opposition claims independent confirmation panels prevent supervisor agenda capture, but supervisor approval is mandatory before panels convene. University of South Australia requires supervisors approve proposals before submission to coordinators; ECU requires supervisor satisfaction before Associate Dean review; UWA requires supervisor endorsement before panel access. Panels cannot protect against supervisor control because they only see supervisor-filtered proposals. Research shows Australian supervisors increasingly adopt directive styles aligning student topics with supervisor interests to serve their performance outcomes. Panel independence after supervisor approval filtering provides no protection against the agenda capture occurring at the mandatory approval stage.

### Attacking opp_007

**Type:** warrant_attack

The opposition claims supervisor approval prevents topic-supervisor mismatches, but this assumes supervisors reject topics based solely on viability rather than agenda fit. Research shows directive supervision in Australia aligns student topics with supervisor interests and performance metrics, not student passion. The mandatory approval requirement means students whose gut-driven topics don't serve supervisor agendas cannot reach confirmation panels to get independent viability assessment. This transforms approval from protecting students into protecting supervisor interests. Students face supervisor-change trauma precisely because approval requirements trap them with supervisors whose agendas conflict with student interests.

### Attacking opp_006

**Type:** warrant_attack

The opposition's protective gatekeeping narrative fails because research on self-determination theory shows supervisor control creates autonomy thwarting that produces controlled motivation, demotivation, and reduced engagement. When Australian supervisors use directive styles and mandatory approval to align student topics with supervisor interests, this autonomy frustration creates the exact motivational damage preventing completion. The documented PhD failures describe students who ignored supervisor warnings, proving gatekeeping cannot prevent determined students from pursuing topics. But requiring supervisor approval for all students damages autonomous motivation for the majority whose topics supervisors control. The mental health crisis among Australian PhD students stems from this autonomy thwarting.
