## Claim

PhD students lack the domain expertise necessary to accurately assess research topic viability, leading to systematically flawed judgments about scope, feasibility, and contribution potential.

## Grounds

### 1. Dunning & Kruger (1999), documented in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect and https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/dunning-kruger-effect

> The Dunning-Kruger effect demonstrates that individuals with low ability in a specific domain give overly positive assessments of their ability. In the original study, participants in the bottom quartile of performance rated their skills far above average - those in the 12th percentile self-rated their expertise at the 62nd percentile on average. The researchers identified a dual burden: not only do those with limited knowledge reach mistaken conclusions, but their incompetence robs them of the metacognitive ability to recognize their errors. Novices lack knowledge of what they don't know, making complexity and depth invisible to them.

**Relevance:** PhD students beginning their research are definitionally novices in identifying research frontiers, making them susceptible to overconfident misjudgment of topic viability.

### 2. Academia Stack Exchange community consensus, https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/98469/how-to-find-a-gap-in-knowledge-for-my-phd

> Beginning PhD students are not expected to have good knowledge of where the research frontier is. Finding knowledge gaps and their associated deeper problems is where important discoveries and career success start, but most students and early-career researchers struggle to even find them. PhD advisors play a key role in this process precisely because students lack this capability.

**Relevance:** The inability to identify genuine research gaps means students cannot reliably distinguish between productive topics and dead ends when following their gut.

### 3. Research on doctoral topic selection frameworks, https://www.phdassistance.com/services/phd-dissertation/phd-topic-selection/

> Over 50,000 research scholars enroll for PhD degrees across India annually, but only one-third successfully complete the degree. Research indicates that poor dissertation topic selection is one of the important reasons for failure and dropout. Common mistakes include choosing topics that are too broad (leading to lack of focus) or overly narrow (insufficient material for complete dissertation), both representing scope judgment failures.

**Relevance:** Empirical evidence directly links poor topic selection judgment to PhD failure, demonstrating that intuition without expertise produces systematically bad outcomes.

## Warrant

When individuals lack domain expertise, their intuitive judgments about that domain are systematically unreliable because they cannot perceive the complexity they need to navigate. PhD students' gut feelings about research topics reflect this cognitive limitation.

## Backing

Metacognition - the ability to accurately assess one's own knowledge and performance - develops through domain expertise. Without sufficient expertise, self-assessment mechanisms fail systematically rather than randomly.

## Qualifier

In most cases
