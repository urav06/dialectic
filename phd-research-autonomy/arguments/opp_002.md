## Claim

Students cannot reliably predict which topics will sustain engagement because passion develops through expertise acquisition during research, making initial gut feelings systematically misleading.

## Grounds

### 1. Psychological Science research on passion cultivation, https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/07/24/study-creating-your-passions-more-effective-finding-them and https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8375551/

> Research published in Psychological Science demonstrates that passions are not inherent traits waiting to be found but are cultivated through engagement and mastery. Students with a growth mindset about passion understand that interests develop through investigation and deliberate practice. Studies show students who believe passion is developed leverage cultivation strategies like building experience and familiarity with subjects, rather than relying on initial feelings. With a growth mindset, students are less likely to give up when chosen passions become challenging because they recognize that depth of interest emerges through the process of engaging with material.

**Relevance:** This establishes that passion is not accessible through initial introspection but develops through sustained engagement, contradicting the claim that students possess unique expertise about what will fascinate them.

### 2. Academia Stack Exchange community experience and Cal Newport's mastery-centric research, https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/110538/is-passion-a-must-have-for-a-masters-student and https://ahappyphd.org/posts/phd-so-good-1/

> Academic practitioners report there is no way to have passion for anything until you master it at some level. One researcher describes getting quite good at their subject through study, then liking it increasingly as they solved complex problems, eventually finding research problems they liked enough not to change careers. Cal Newport's mastery-centric view demonstrates that almost any superficial interest can be transformed into passion through hard work and deliberate practice. Meaning emerges from mastery rather than preceding it—you become passionate about something in the process of pursuing and learning about it more deeply, particularly when dancing at the edge of mastery.

**Relevance:** Direct testimony from successful researchers shows passion follows expertise development, meaning students at the PhD outset lack the mastery necessary to know what will genuinely fascinate them long-term.

### 3. Australian PhD topic evolution research, https://study.uq.edu.au/stories/how-to-decide-phd-topic and https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/7460/what-to-do-when-your-research-interest-changes-to-a-new-topic-half-way-into-your

> University of Queensland research emphasizes that PhD topics frequently change as students progress, make new findings, and discover interesting developments—framed as fairly normal since topics aren't set in stone at the start. Academia practitioners report having yet to meet a single PhD candidate who actually did what they proposed in their research plan initially. Students discover through coursework and professor interactions that their original problems aren't interesting enough to sustain 4-5 years of work, while new research directions revealed through exposure to the field prove more compelling.

**Relevance:** Empirical evidence from Australian doctoral contexts shows initial gut feelings about topics systematically fail to predict what students will find sustainably interesting, as nearly all students discover different passions through the research process.

## Warrant

If passion emerges through mastery and expertise rather than preceding it, then students at the PhD outset cannot accurately introspect about which topics will sustain their engagement for four years, because they lack the domain mastery that generates genuine passion.

## Backing

Psychological research on expertise acquisition demonstrates that novices cannot mentally simulate expert experiences. The phenomenology of mastery-level engagement differs fundamentally from superficial interest, making it epistemically inaccessible to those without domain expertise.

## Attacks

### Attacking prop_001

**Type:** grounds_attack

The first ground mischaracterizes passion as static expertise rather than dynamic process. The cited research shows passion affects engagement through learning pathways, but this describes how existing passion operates, not how students identify future passion at the PhD outset. The evidence that passionate students invest greater cognitive resources doesn't establish that students can reliably predict what will generate that passion before developing mastery. The research on academic climate amplifying passion's effectiveness actually supports the opposition: it demonstrates passion develops through institutional and supervisory support structures, not through isolated gut feeling at topic selection.

### Attacking prop_001

**Type:** warrant_attack

The warrant assumes students possess first-person knowledge of their future motivational states, but epistemology distinguishes between knowledge of current mental states and predictions about future states. Students may know what currently interests them superficially, but mastery-centric research demonstrates that deep sustained fascination emerges through expertise acquisition. Students lack epistemic access to how they will experience topics after developing mastery, making gut feelings unreliable predictors of four-year engagement. The proposition conflates present introspection with future prediction.

## Defends

### Defending opp_000a

**Type:** reinforce

The proposition's distinction between frontier-expertise and passion-expertise fails because passion itself requires domain expertise to develop. The mastery-centric evidence shows students cannot know what will fascinate them long-term without the expertise that generates that fascination. The Dunning-Kruger framework applies precisely because students overestimate their ability to predict future passion without recognizing that deep engagement emerges through the expertise development process they haven't yet undergone. Initial gut feelings reflect superficial interest, not the sustainable passion that mastery creates.
