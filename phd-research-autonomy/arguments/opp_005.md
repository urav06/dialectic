## Claim

Supervisor veto authority protects students from catastrophic commitment to unviable topics, making collaboration essential rather than oppressive.

## Grounds

### 1. PhD failure analysis, https://www.lexacademic.com/blog/it-happened-to-me-how-i-failed-my-phd-and-how-to-pass-yours-lex-academic-blog/ and https://dissertationgenius.com/the-six-laws-of-phd-failure/

> Research on PhD failure identifies scope misjudgment as a primary cause of non-completion. Too many doctoral students begin with broad research topics, realizing too late they have bitten off more than they can chew and taken on much more than anticipated. A poorly defined research question lacking focus results in theses that come across as incoherent and unfocused. European data shows 34% of doctoral candidates fail to complete within six years, with many dropping out entirely, while US estimates suggest 40-50% never finish their degrees. One documented case describes a student reaching year three only to discover their project would not yield publishable or even minimally defensible results, facing the choice between a subpar dissertation or walking away.

**Relevance:** This establishes that gut-driven topic selection without expert gatekeeping leads to catastrophic failures that waste years of student effort.

### 2. Australian confirmation of candidature requirements, https://www.anu.edu.au/students/program-administration/assessments-exams/assessment-of-higher-degree-research and https://students.mq.edu.au/study/graduateresearch/managing-candidature/confirmation

> Australian confirmation panels assess whether candidates have viable research projects achievable within program timeframes, evaluating academic rigor, feasibility, resource requirements, and supervisory panel suitability. Panels determine whether proposed research can meet learning outcomes within program length and identify required professional development. The written proposal must demonstrate feasibility of the research program based on comprehensive literature review, methodology, and timeframe analysis. Panel review determines if the candidate possesses capacity to complete research within available time and resources, with unsatisfactory progress requiring action plans and panel review of progress.

**Relevance:** Confirmation processes institutionalize expert assessment of topic viability precisely because students cannot reliably assess feasibility through gut feeling alone.

### 3. Australian confirmation panel independence requirements, https://www.scu.edu.au/media/scu-dep/graduate-school/documents/Confirmation-of-Candidature-Guidelines.pdf and https://policy.unisq.edu.au/documents/151744PL

> Australian universities require independent panel members with no close links to supervisors to provide objective critical overview. Panel members must not currently be or have previously been part of the supervisory team or closely involved with the research project. Proposed panel members must assess actual or perceived conflicts of interest according to ACGR Good Practice Guidelines, with alternative members appointed where conflicts exist. Supervisors attend confirmation to provide context but do not have voting rights on panel decisions. When power imbalances exist—such as supervisors holding executive positions—additional senior observers join panels to ensure objectivity.

**Relevance:** Independent confirmation review prevents supervisor agenda capture, allowing expert viability assessment while protecting against the supervisory control the proposition fears.

## Warrant

If scope misjudgment causes systematic PhD failure, and students cannot reliably assess topic feasibility without expertise, then supervisor gatekeeping functions as protection preventing catastrophic commitment to unviable topics rather than oppression of student autonomy.

## Backing

Risk management theory establishes that gatekeeping by knowledgeable parties prevents irreversible harmful commitments. When novices face high-stakes decisions with asymmetric information, expert veto power serves protective rather than oppressive functions.

## Qualifier

in Australian PhD contexts

## Attacks

### Attacking prop_004

**Type:** warrant_attack

The proposition's framing of veto power as oppression ignores its protective function. PhD failure evidence shows 34-50% of students abandon degrees, often because initial topics proved unviable—too broad, methodologically infeasible, or lacking defensible contributions. Supervisor gatekeeping prevents students from committing four years to doomed projects. The proposition treats all veto power as domination, but protective gatekeeping differs fundamentally from agenda imposition. Independent confirmation panels with conflict-of-interest protections enable supervisors to reject unviable topics while preventing supervisors from imposing their agendas. This transforms veto power from oppression into safeguarding.

### Attacking prop_003

**Type:** grounds_attack

The first ground claims Australian applications require binding topic commitment, but this misrepresents confirmation processes. Universities explicitly assess whether candidates have viable projects during confirmation 6-12 months post-enrollment, evaluating feasibility and capacity to complete within timeframes. Panels require comprehensive proposals demonstrating methodology and resource analysis—assessment impossible at application. Application proposals are preliminary starting points; confirmation determines actual viability through expert panel review including independent members. The temporal paradox dissolves: students propose initial interests at application, then supervisor collaboration during confirmation transforms these into viable projects or identifies fatal flaws before catastrophic time investment.

## Defends

### Defending opp_004

**Type:** reinforce

The proposition attacks confirmation processes as insufficient protection, but their own power asymmetry evidence supports our position. Independent panel members with no supervisory team links and mandatory conflict-of-interest assessment prevent agenda capture. Supervisors lack voting rights on confirmation decisions. When power imbalances exist, additional senior observers ensure objectivity. This institutional architecture enables supervisor expertise to assess viability while preventing the supervisory control prop_002 identifies. The confirmation process operationalizes our collaborative model: students propose gut-driven interests, supervisors provide viability guidance, independent panels adjudicate disagreements.
