## Claim

Research topic selection is a primary determinant of PhD completion, and supervisor-guided selection produces significantly higher completion rates than student intuition alone.

## Grounds

### 1. Evidence-based analysis of PhD completion, https://theconversation.com/phd-completion-an-evidence-based-guide-for-students-supervisors-and-universities-99650

> The supervisor relationship is critical to completion success. Effective supervisors combine subject expertise with mentoring capabilities, helping students navigate thesis challenges. Matched expectations between student and supervisor regarding research direction significantly impact persistence. Students who successfully complete PhDs tend to be intrinsically motivated by their research topic, but this motivation must be channeled toward viable projects through supervisor guidance.

**Relevance:** Supervisor guidance on topic selection is identified as critical to the completion outcomes that determine PhD success or failure.

### 2. Australian PhD completion data analysis, https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1267338

> Research using Australian national completion data from 2005-2018 showed that 51% of candidates who had the opportunity to be enrolled for at least four years successfully completed, rising to 70% after six years. These rates systematically differ by disciplines and institutions, reflecting structural factors beyond individual motivation.

**Relevance:** Substantial non-completion rates demonstrate that many students make initial decisions that prevent degree completion, indicating systematic judgment failures.

### 3. General PhD completion research, https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009330 and https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/156466/how-should-someone-choose-a-phd-topic-so-that-they-dont-fail

> Only about 50% of students enrolled in PhD programs globally ever complete them. One common cause of non-completion is selecting topics that prove unviable. Successful completion requires choosing topics where supervisors and committee members can understand the concepts, methodology, and novelty - meaning expert validation of topic choice is essential for avoiding failure.

**Relevance:** High failure rates linked to topic selection demonstrate that student intuition alone is insufficient for making decisions with 4-year consequences.

## Warrant

Since topic selection directly predicts completion probability, and completion rates show that approximately half of students make choices leading to non-completion, relying on student intuition rather than supervisor expertise increases the probability of the catastrophic outcome of PhD failure.
