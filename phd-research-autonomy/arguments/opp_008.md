## Claim

Students systematically underestimate their need for expert topic guidance while supervisors underestimate student vulnerability, making collaborative selection essential for closing this dangerous perception gap.

## Grounds

### 1. Research on PhD supervision expectation mismatches, https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07294360.2021.1874887 and https://prelights.biologists.com/highlights/supervising-the-phd-identifying-common-mismatches-in-expectations-between-candidate-and-supervisor-to-improve-research-training-outcomes/

> Research surveying PhD candidates and supervisors found the most common mismatch was perception of guidance quality and quantity: 82% of supervisors believed they always provided guidance, but only 64% of candidates agreed they received it when needed. Double the number of supervisors ranked their guidance as high-quality compared to students. Critically, more than 20% of students said they received little or no guidance overall, but only 3% of supervisors said they left students to their own devices. This perception gap occurs because supervisors often provided guidance only when candidates explicitly asked, while candidates perceived receiving supervision less frequently than supervisors reported giving it. Communication deficiencies affect 78% of graduate students, expectation mismatches occur in 73% of cases, and relationship quality directly correlates with completion rates: students with strong supervisory relationships demonstrate 89% completion rates compared to 43% for those with poor relationships.

**Relevance:** This establishes that students cannot accurately assess how much guidance they need, while supervisors cannot accurately perceive student guidance deficits, creating systematic judgment failures requiring structured collaboration to bridge.

### 2. Research on PhD attrition and lack of supervisor support, https://www.discoverphds.com/advice/doing/phd-failure-rate and https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2158244016659116

> Attrition rates in doctoral programs reach 33-70% of those who start, with up to 50% of PhD students dropping out due to feelings of incompetence and lack of support from supervisors. Supervisor lack of interest is related to PhD students' quit intentions and actual attrition. Research shows lack of structure and solitary work despite students requiring significant guidance leads to confusion, isolation, and hopelessness, negatively impacting wellbeing and completion. Faculty are often unaware of their role in student dropout: semi-structured interviews with 60 doctoral students and 34 faculty showed 74% of faculty perceived attrition as students lacking skills or motivation, not recognizing supervision failures. Supervisors adopt wait-and-see attitudes believing adult learners should ask for help, while students struggle without recognizing they need more guidance than they're requesting.

**Relevance:** Demonstrates that students following their gut without structured supervisor engagement systematically fail to seek guidance they desperately need, producing the catastrophic dropout rates collaborative selection prevents.

### 3. Research on doctoral supervision quality and completion outcomes, https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0328471 and https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14703297.2023.2238673

> High-quality supervision is one of the main determinants of successful PhD completion and study wellbeing. Access to frequent supervision meetings at least once a month are key determinants of degree completion and reduce dropout risk. Matched support aligned to candidates' needs contributes to study progress, reduces dropout risk, and increases satisfaction. Students tend to benefit from supervisors who demonstrate strength in both research and teaching, with supervisor quality rather than seniority playing the crucial role. Students with strong supervisory relationships demonstrate 89% completion rates compared to 43% for poor relationships. Early-stage selection decisions either facilitate smooth progress or lead to irreversible conflicts impacting completion rates and research quality.

**Relevance:** Shows that supervisor engagement quality determines completion, and early collaborative topic selection creates the matched support essential for the 89% completion rates collaborative relationships produce versus 43% for poor relationships.

## Warrant

When students systematically underestimate their guidance needs while supervisors underestimate student vulnerability, and this perception gap produces 33-70% attrition rates versus 89% completion when alignment exists, gut-driven topic selection without structured collaborative refinement perpetuates the judgment failures driving dropout, while collaborative selection creates the matched support eliminating the perception gap.

## Backing

Cognitive psychology establishes that metacognitive accuracy—knowing what you don't know—develops through expertise. Novices cannot assess their own knowledge deficits, creating systematic perception gaps that expert-guided processes correct.

## Attacks

### Attacking prop_007

**Type:** warrant_attack

The mental health argument conflates supervisor control with supervisor collaboration. The cited evidence shows autonomy frustration from controlling approaches damages wellbeing, but collaborative topic refinement provides autonomy support, not control. The perception gap research reveals the actual mental health threat: students who receive inadequate guidance experience confusion, isolation, and hopelessness, with only 43% completion rates versus 89% for students with strong supervisory relationships. Gut-driven selection without collaborative refinement produces the guidance deficit creating mental health crises, not the structured engagement that prevents them through matched support aligned to student needs.

### Attacking prop_006

**Type:** grounds_attack

The proposition claims supervisor approval gates panel access oppressively, but the perception gap evidence reveals why this gatekeeping protects students. More than 20% of students believe they receive adequate guidance when supervisors haven't provided it, while students struggle without recognizing they need help. Supervisors function as reality checks preventing students from committing to topics students cannot accurately assess. The 89% versus 43% completion rate differential shows collaborative refinement with supervisor engagement produces dramatically better outcomes than students pursuing topics without structured guidance. Supervisor approval ensures topics reaching panels have already survived the reality-testing that gut feelings alone cannot provide.
