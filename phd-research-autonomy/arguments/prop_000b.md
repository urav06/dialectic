## Claim

Student-driven topic selection produces more innovative research outcomes than supervisor-assigned topics because autonomy enables creative risk-taking essential for breakthrough discoveries.

## Grounds

### 1. Graduate student innovation research (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9249313/)

> Empirical research found academic support from supervisors was negatively associated with idea generation and idea search, indicating excessive supervisor direction reduces novel thinking. Graduate students experienced decreased motivation, low self-confidence, and feelings of being overcontrolled when supervisors tightly controlled research matters including topic selection. Tight control of research-related matters limited students' initiative and originality, directly inhibiting the generation and search for novel ideas.

**Relevance:** This demonstrates supervisor topic control creates an oppressive research environment incompatible with the creative freedom necessary for innovative contributions to knowledge.

### 2. European research on funder-influenced PhD topics (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048733315002000)

> PhD students trained in groups where funders influenced thesis research topics produced lower scientific productivity and citation impact compared to students with autonomous topic selection. While these students were more likely to stay in academia, controlling for career destination revealed that external topic control reduced scholarly quality and innovation.

**Relevance:** External control over topic selection, whether from supervisors or funders, demonstrably diminishes research quality and impact even when students complete their degrees.

## Warrant

Since innovation requires intellectual risk-taking and creative autonomy, and since supervisor-determined topics inherently constrain students to established research agendas, gut-driven topic choice creates the conditions necessary for breakthrough discoveries.

## Backing

Creativity research establishes that intrinsic motivation and psychological safety enable divergent thinking and novel problem-solving, while external control and evaluation threats suppress creative outputs.

## Qualifier

especially in fields requiring conceptual innovation
