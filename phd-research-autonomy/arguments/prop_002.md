## Claim

The supervisor-student power asymmetry renders collaborative topic selection structurally incapable of protecting student autonomy, necessitating gut-driven choice.

## Grounds

### 1. BMC Medical Education qualitative study on PhD supervision disagreement (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3851003/)

> Research examining disagreements between PhD students and supervisors found that students experienced disagreements more often than supervisors acknowledged. Students initially deferred to supervisor topic preferences because 'he is a professor, he is experienced, he knows about these things,' treating supervisory suggestions as mandatory even when students wanted different research directions. This dynamic resulted in students following inadequately-considered advice and experiencing lost time. The study documented that only after gaining expertise through years of doctoral work did students feel confident pursuing their preferred research direction, with supervisors ultimately being 'outmaneuvered and outthought' as student subject knowledge surpassed supervisors in specialized areas.

**Relevance:** Demonstrates that collaboration fails early when it matters most: students systematically suppress their gut preferences due to power asymmetry at topic selection.

### 2. Australian Council of Graduate Research analysis of supervision power dynamics (https://www.acgr.edu.au/impact-blog/the-dynamics-of-power-in-doctoral-supervision-teams/)

> Research on Australian doctoral supervision identifies governance structures where rank, seniority, experience, age, and gender create power dynamics that determine whether students experience empowerment or disempowerment. Policy interpretation defines the social positions of team members, directly affecting students' capacity to exercise agency and achieve preferred outcomes. While guidance recommends students 'negotiate the team mode that works best,' the structural positioning makes actual parity in research decisions questionable, requiring students to advocate against institutional hierarchies.

**Relevance:** Australian PhD governance structures create power asymmetries that prevent genuine collaboration, making student gut-driven autonomy the only defense against institutional subordination.

### 3. Research on doctoral supervision rhetoric versus practice (https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02602938.2024.2307332)

> Analysis reveals an inherent discrepancy in supervision assumptions: the first assumes both parties are autonomous equals capable of debating research direction; the second positions the supervisor as wise authority and examiner while the student is willing disciple needing guidance. These assumptions inherently conflict because one scenario presumes equality while the other establishes distinct power imbalance. This discrepancy produces conflicts when supervisors expect candidates to voice concerns as rational equals, while candidates feel submissive or deferential to supervisory authority, perceiving disagreement as inappropriate. One consequence is supervisors remain unaware of candidates' true views because students pretend to understand when they don't.

**Relevance:** The collaborative ideal contradicts the structural reality of supervision, creating conditions where students cannot genuinely express topic preferences, requiring gut-following as protective autonomy.

## Warrant

Since collaborative topic selection presumes equal negotiating power that the supervisor-student relationship structurally precludes, and since students systematically suppress gut preferences under power asymmetry, following their gut becomes the necessary mechanism for asserting autonomous topic choice that collaboration cannot deliver.

## Backing

Social power theory establishes that hierarchical relationships create systematic distortions in communication and decision-making. The subordinate party performs deference even when privately disagreeing, making genuine collaboration impossible without structural equality.

## Attacks

### Attacking opp_001

**Type:** grounds_attack

The opposition cites self-determination theory research stating autonomy and guidance are complementary, not opposing forces. But their own source reveals the critical caveat: the advisor 'managed to integrate' supervisor needs 'within ideas and interests the student had'—meaning student interests determined the foundation. The source describes this integration as 'tricky from an autonomy point of view,' acknowledging tension. Genuine collaboration requires the student's gut-driven topic forming the core that supervisors help refine, not supervisors selecting topics that students pretend to accept. The evidence supports our position: start with student passion, add supervisor methodology guidance.

## Defends

### Defending prop_000b

**Type:** clarify

The opposition claims we misinterpret research on supervisor control. But we distinguish between two scenarios: supervisor control over topic selection versus supervisor guidance on methodology. The research showing tight control reduces innovation specifically references 'control of research-related matters including topic selection.' We advocate gut-driven topic choice with supervisor methodological guidance—precisely the partnership model that preserves innovation. The opposition conflates topic autonomy with methodological isolation, creating a false equivalence we never claimed.
