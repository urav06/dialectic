## Claim

Effective topic selection requires integrating student passion with supervisor expertise through collaborative development, making the gut-versus-supervisor dichotomy fundamentally misleading.

## Grounds

### 1. Self-determination theory research on doctoral persistence (https://ahappyphd.org/posts/choosing-not-drop-out/)

> Research applying self-determination theory to PhD persistence reveals that framing dropout as either the student's fault or the supervisor's fault is a false dichotomy. Self-determination theory proposes that all humans need to be competent, autonomous, and related to others. Students feel intrinsically motivated when activities meet these needs simultaneously. The critical insight is that autonomy and expert guidance are not opposing forces but complementary requirements. One researcher described how advisors realigned their research to address project needs: the re-adjustment was tricky from an autonomy point of view, but they managed to integrate it conceptually within ideas and interests the student had, so the project still made sense to them.

**Relevance:** This demonstrates that successful PhD topic selection satisfies both autonomy needs and competence development through integration, not binary choice between gut feeling and supervisor direction.

### 2. Research on collaborative doctoral supervision (https://www.mdpi.com/2673-8392/3/1/4 and https://www.nsphdeducation.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Doctoral-Supervision-Handbook-2022-1.pdf)

> Studies of doctoral supervision practices identify the supervisor's core responsibility as assisting with identification of a research topic that is suitable for the student and manageable within the scope of the degree. Effective supervision develops the doctoral student into an autonomous researcher capable of independent thinking through a partnership approach, not a traditional mentor-mentee hierarchy. The first supervisor's role is to develop student autonomy by encouraging students to recognize they will become the subject expert and helping them discover their own voice. This collaborative process integrates student interests with expert boundary knowledge.

**Relevance:** Supervisors don't impose topics against student interests; they help students transform intuitive interests into viable research programs through expert-guided topic development.

### 3. Analysis of PhD failure causes (https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/156466/how-should-someone-choose-a-phd-topic-so-that-they-dont-fail and https://matt.might.net/articles/ways-to-fail-a-phd/)

> Research on PhD failure identifies two opposite but equally catastrophic mistakes in topic selection. First, letting advisors choose research topics for students without incorporating student interests leads to motivational failure. Second, students choosing topics without expert guidance leads to viability failure. The evidence shows that successful completion requires topics where supervisors and committee members can understand the concepts, methodology, and novelty, while students possess genuine interest. At the start of a PhD, project idea failure rates can reach ninety percent; expertise reduces this to fifty percent. Expert guidance is crucial because going big without advisor input makes it very easy to end up with something not realistically doable on a PhD timeframe.

**Relevance:** Empirical evidence shows both extremes fail: supervisor-imposed topics without student buy-in, and student-selected topics without expert validation both produce high failure rates.

## Warrant

Since successful topic selection requires both intrinsic motivation and expert feasibility assessment working in concert, and since collaborative development processes integrate these requirements, the motion's framing of gut versus supervisor as opposing choices misrepresents how viable PhD topics actually emerge.

## Backing

Self-determination theory establishes that autonomy and competence are complementary psychological needs, not competing values. Meeting one need while frustrating another produces controlled motivation and poor outcomes. Only activities satisfying both needs simultaneously generate the autonomous motivation required for doctoral persistence.

## Attacks

### Attacking prop_000a

**Type:** warrant_attack

The warrant claims student-chosen topics create autonomous motivation while supervisor-imposed topics create controlled motivation, but this mischaracterizes the opposition position. The evidence cited actually supports collaborative development: the Australian data showing intrinsic motivation predicts completion doesn't establish that students should choose topics without supervisor input. The Self-Determination Theory research explicitly states autonomy and competence needs must both be satisfied. Collaborative topic development where supervisors help students transform interests into viable projects satisfies both needs, while purely gut-driven selection satisfies autonomy but frustrates competence by exposing students to the ninety percent project failure rate novices experience. The warrant conflates supervisor guidance with supervisor imposition.

### Attacking prop_000b

**Type:** grounds_attack

The first ground misinterprets the cited research on supervisor control. The study found excessive supervisor direction reduces innovation, but this doesn't support gut-driven topic selection without guidance. The research describes tight control of research-related matters limiting initiative, not collaborative topic development. Supervisors assisting with topic identification while developing student autonomy represents the partnership model that fosters innovation, not the supervisory control the study critiques. The evidence actually undermines the proposition by showing both extremes fail: excessive control and insufficient guidance both produce poor outcomes.
