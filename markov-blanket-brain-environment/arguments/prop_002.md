## Claim

Markov blankets emerge from thermodynamic self-organization processes that physically maintain brain-environment boundaries, not from arbitrary mathematical partitioning.

## Grounds

### 1. Kirchhoff et al. (2018), The Markov blankets of life, Journal of The Royal Society Interface, https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5805980/

> Living systems maintain themselves far from thermodynamic equilibrium through operationally closed metabolic processes that constitute recurrent self-organizing boundaries. Markov blankets self-assemble through these physical processes: multiple blankets can self-organize into larger systems that themselves possess Markov blankets, from cellular organelles and DNA molecules up to organisms and their environments. The very existence of living systems is construed as a process of boundary conservation through autopoietic organization, where systems autonomously produce their own components and maintain their boundaries through continuous energetic coupling.

**Relevance:** This demonstrates that Markov blankets are discovered features of self-organizing biological systems, not arbitrary researcher-imposed abstractions, directly refuting the claim that blanket boundaries lack correspondence with natural physical structure.

### 2. Friston et al. (2021), 'Stochastic Chaos and Markov Blankets', Entropy, https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34573845/

> At nonequilibrium steady-state, random dynamical systems exhibit conditional independencies where internal states are statistically secluded from external states by blanket states. The dependencies induced by Markov blanket presence keep systems far from thermodynamic equilibrium, establishing kinetic barriers that constitute the system's parts and maintain energy gradients. These conditional independence structures connect sparse influences in Langevin dynamics to specific state subset partitions determined by the system's physical dynamics.

**Relevance:** The mathematical structure of conditional independence emerges from physical nonequilibrium dynamics rather than being arbitrarily imposed, showing that blanket partitions correspond to objective thermodynamic boundaries maintained by the system itself.

> Bacterial chemoreceptor arrays exhibit asymmetric switching dynamics signifying time-reversal symmetry breaking, explained only by interplay between dissipative reactions within core units and cooperative coupling between neighboring units. Thermodynamic irreversibility in sensory transduction processes establishes directional information flow that cannot be reversed, creating physically grounded boundaries for signal transmission.

**Relevance:** Time-reversal symmetry breaking demonstrates that sensory boundaries are physical consequences of thermodynamic irreversibility, not mathematical conveniences, establishing objective directionality in brain-environment coupling through fundamental physical constraints.

## Warrant

When biological boundaries are maintained by thermodynamically irreversible self-organizing processes that keep systems at nonequilibrium steady-state, these boundaries exist as physical features of the system rather than as arbitrary mathematical partitions imposed by observers.

## Backing

The distinction between discovered and stipulated boundaries rests on whether partitioning corresponds to physical processes; thermodynamic self-organization provides precisely this physical grounding by establishing boundaries through energy dissipation and operational closure.

## Qualifier

in thermodynamically open, autopoietic systems

## Attacks

### Attacking opp_000a

**Type:** grounds_attack

The claim that blanket partitions are stipulated wherever convenient ignores that biological Markov blankets correspond to physically maintained boundaries. Living systems sustain themselves through metabolic processes that establish operational closure while remaining thermodynamically open, creating self-assembled boundaries from molecules to organisms. These boundaries persist through continuous physical self-organization, not researcher convenience. The grasshopper example actually demonstrates blanket reconfiguration during development, not arbitrary redefinition—chrysalis formation exemplifies life-cycle boundary reorganization, a real biological phenomenon. Confusing epistemic tools with ontological claims fails when the mathematical formalism captures actual physical processes of autopoietic boundary maintenance.

## Defends

### Defending prop_000b

**Type:** clarify

Efferent modulation does not violate unidirectional sensory architecture but exemplifies hierarchical Markov blanket structure. In predictive processing, efferent signals constitute active states of higher hierarchical levels modulating sensory precision weights at lower levels, not environmental information bypassing the blanket. Olivocochlear neurons modify outer hair cell gain, controlling which environmental signals reach threshold for neural transduction. This implements precision weighting where internal predictions adjust sensory sensitivity while environmental energy still converts unidirectionally through receptor transduction. The blanket remains: environment affects receptors, brain modulates receptor sensitivity via descending active states, maintaining conditional independence through hierarchical mediation.
