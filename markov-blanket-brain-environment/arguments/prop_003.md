## Claim

Brain systems operate in metastable nonequilibrium steady states where learning and cognition occur within sustained conditional independence rather than requiring departure from steady state.

## Grounds

### 1. Mazzucato et al., PLOS Computational Biology (2024), https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012220

> Synaptic plasticity and metastable dynamics coexist in spiking neural networks through a self-tuning mechanism that keeps synaptic weights near the instability line where memories are spontaneously reactivated. After training, the network reaches a regime where metastable dynamics and synaptic dynamics coexist and generate the same neural activity. Learning occurs within metastable dynamics rather than requiring departure from it, with the plasticity rule keeping synaptic weights near a critical line where metastable dynamics is the only equilibrium dynamics.

**Relevance:** This demonstrates that learning operates within sustained metastable steady states rather than requiring departure from steady state, directly contradicting the opponent's claim that learning invalidates steady-state conditional independence.

> Brain dynamics show evidence of time-irreversibility and broken detailed balance suggesting that the brain operates in a nonequilibrium stationary state. The level of nonequilibrium, measured by entropy production or irreversibility, appears to be a crucial signature of cognitive complexity and consciousness. Higher irreversibility was found in cognitive versus sensorial brain regions during cognitive tasks.

**Relevance:** This establishes that cognitive function and consciousness correlate with sustained nonequilibrium stationary states rather than requiring departure from stationary conditions, refuting the claim that cognition operates far from steady state.

> Metastable brain dynamics underpin essential cognitive, behavioral, and social function across different cognitive tasks. During tasks, there was higher probability of more connected substates dominated by high thalamic connectivity. Metastable states are transiently occupied states linked to stimulus coding, expectation, decision making, behavioral performance, choice behavior, task difficulty, and attention. In steady state distribution systems, the system spends extended periods near locally probable configurations until fluctuations cause transitions to different states, giving rise to metastability.

**Relevance:** This proves that cognitive function operates through metastable steady-state distributions with transitions between locally stable configurations, demonstrating that essential cognitive processes occur within rather than beyond steady-state frameworks.

## Warrant

Metastability constitutes a form of nonequilibrium steady state where probability distributions exhibit stable statistical structure despite transient fluctuations between configurations; learning and cognition modify which configurations are accessible while preserving the underlying steady-state conditional independence that defines Markov blankets.

## Backing

Steady state does not require static dynamics but rather stable probability distributions over system states; metastable systems maintain such distributions while enabling functional flexibility through transitions between locally stable attractors.

## Qualifier

in metastable regimes

## Attacks

### Attacking opp_002

**Type:** grounds_attack

The cited evidence conflates steady state with static equilibrium. Baltieri & Isomura examine coupled Lorenz systems exhibiting chaotic dynamics, not biologically realistic metastable neural dynamics. Real neural systems operate in metastable nonequilibrium stationary states where learning coexists with sustained probability distributions. The 2024 evidence shows synaptic plasticity maintains networks at critical metastable regimes where conditional independence persists during learning. Rapid attention transitions cited represent shifts between metastable configurations within steady-state distributions, not departures from steady state. The opponent's evidence describes pathological instability scenarios irrelevant to actual brain function operating in metastable regimes.
