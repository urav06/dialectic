## Claim

Brain-body-environment systems exhibit continuous bidirectional coupling that fundamentally violates the conditional independence required for Markov blanket separation.

## Grounds

### 1. Chemero (2015), 'Radical embodied cognitive neuroscience', Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4422034/

> Functional connectivity generates complex system-wide dynamics enabling local regions to participate across cognitive tasks. Emotional and cognitive states manifest as bodily arousal patterns tracked by interoceptive brain processes, creating reciprocal loops. Brain regions exhibit pluripotency and degeneracy where the same region performs multiple functions depending on dynamically varying network context. Understanding psychological function requires examining the whole brain-body-environment system rather than treating the brain as an independent processor.

**Relevance:** This evidence shows that brain function emerges from continuous reciprocal interaction across putative boundaries, preventing the statistical independence that defines Markov blankets.

### 2. Dynamical systems theory in cognitive science, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/embodied-cognition/

> Dynamically-oriented cognitive scientists regard cognition as the product of interactions between brain, body, and world, comprising a single coupled system. The co-occurrence of terms in coupled differential equations shows behaviors are co-dependent, making them constituents of a single system whose relationships are captured in equations without clean separability.

**Relevance:** Coupled differential equations mathematically encode continuous mutual influence, which is incompatible with the conditional independence assumption that external states depend only on blanket states, not internal states.

## Warrant

Markov blankets require that internal and external states be conditionally independent given blanket states, but continuous bidirectional coupling means internal states directly influence external states and vice versa, violating this independence condition.

## Backing

Conditional independence A⊥B|C requires P(A,B|C)=P(A|C)P(B|C); this fails when A and B are described by coupled differential equations expressing mutual dependence.

## Qualifier

under conditions of tight coupling
