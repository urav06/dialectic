## Claim

Sensory receptors function as one-way transduction boundaries that convert environmental energy into neural signals while preventing reverse information flow.

## Grounds

### 1. StatPearls Physiology chapter on Sensory Receptors, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK539861/

> All sensory signals begin as receptor potentials at the transduction boundary where environmental stimuli trigger molecular cascades: photoreceptors convert light through rhodopsin activation, mechanoreceptors use stretch-activated channels for pressure, chemoreceptors employ G-protein coupled receptors for taste and smell. Each system follows the labeled line principle, transducing specific stimulus types into discrete neural pathways to the brain.

**Relevance:** These specialized unidirectional mechanisms establish sensory states as the exclusive input channel, preventing environmental information from bypassing this boundary to directly affect brain internal states.

## Warrant

Because transduction mechanisms convert non-neural environmental energy into standardized neural signals through irreversible molecular processes, information can only flow inward through these channels, establishing them as a necessary sensory boundary.

## Backing

Thermodynamic irreversibility in molecular cascades (rhodopsin photoisomerization, ion channel conformational changes) ensures these transduction processes cannot operate in reverse to transmit brain states back through sensory receptors.
