## Claim

Motor systems constitute active states that transmit brain predictions to environment without allowing environmental states to directly penetrate internal neural representations.

## Grounds

### 1. Adams et al., Brain Structure and Function (2013), https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3637647/

> Under active inference, descending motor signals are proprioceptive predictions rather than motor commands. These predictions specify desired sensory consequences and are fulfilled through peripheral reflex mechanisms at the spinal cord level. Prediction errors between descending predictions and actual proprioceptive feedback automatically trigger muscle contractions that resolve the discrepancy, making movement an emergent property of prediction fulfillment.

**Relevance:** This architecture ensures motor output channels transmit internal predictions outward to change the environment, while environmental mechanical resistance only affects peripheral sensory feedback, not the central predictive representations themselves.

## Warrant

Since motor predictions originate internally and use peripheral reflexes to fulfill them, the active channel operates unidirectionally from brain to environment, with environmental forces only influencing subsequent sensory input rather than directly modifying internal predictive models.

## Backing

The hierarchical organization of predictive coding separates high-level internal representations from low-level motor execution, with prediction errors serving as the interface that preserves conditional independence while enabling adaptive behavior.

## Qualifier

within predictive processing frameworks
