## Claim

Markov blankets are mathematical conveniences imposed on continuous systems, not natural boundaries discovered in neural architecture.

## Grounds

### 1. Raja et al. (2021), 'The Markov blanket trick: On the scope of the free energy principle', Physics of Life Reviews, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1571064521000634

> The Markov blanket partition is stipulated as being located exactly wherever happens to be convenient for the purposes of the model. What counts as internal, external, or blanket state bears little relationship with structural properties or boundaries of the systems of interest. There is persistent confusion between the formal use of Markov blankets as an epistemic tool for Bayesian inference and their novel metaphysical use in the free energy framework to demarcate the physical boundary between an agent and its environment.

**Relevance:** This demonstrates that Markov blanket boundaries are researcher-imposed abstractions rather than naturally occurring separations, contradicting the motion's existential claim.

### 2. Bruineberg et al. (2020), 'The Emperor's New Markov Blankets', http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/18467/

> When a grasshopper moves, the structure of the Markov blanket changes radically, or maintaining a single blanket requires it to become extremely large and complicated. The approach stretches the original notion of a Markov blanket in a philosophically unprincipled manner, distinguishing between Pearl blankets (standard statistical tools) and Friston blankets (ontological claims).

**Relevance:** This reveals that maintaining stable Markov blankets across realistic biological scenarios requires arbitrary redefinition, exposing the formalism's inadequacy for describing actual brain-environment boundaries.

## Warrant

If boundaries are stipulated by modelers rather than discovered in nature, and if maintaining these boundaries requires arbitrary adjustments as systems evolve, then no such boundary genuinely exists as a feature of the physical system itself.

## Backing

The distinction between epistemic tools (map) and ontological entities (territory) is fundamental to scientific realism; conflating statistical abstractions with physical boundaries commits a category error.

## Qualifier

in biological systems undergoing continuous change
