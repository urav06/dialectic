## Claim

Brain-environment coupling operates across multiple independent timescales simultaneously, making conditional independence timescale-relative and preventing identification of the Markov blanket.

## Grounds

### 1. Murray et al. (2014), Nature Neuroscience; analyzed in PMC7486728, https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7486728/

> Neural systems exhibit four distinct independent timescales operating in parallel: intrinsic timescales reflecting ongoing fluctuations, seasonal timescales across trials, reward-memory timescales, and choice-memory timescales. These timescales show no relationship to each other across individual neurons in a given area, indicating separate neural mechanisms generate each timescale rather than one unified temporal system. Different cortical areas integrate information at different rates for behavioral adjustments on different timescales.

**Relevance:** This demonstrates that brain-environment interaction has no privileged temporal grain, making any Markov blanket analysis timescale-relative rather than a feature of the physical system.

### 2. Golesorkhi et al. (2021), Communications Biology, https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-021-02483-6

> The brain displays complex multiscale temporal organization with different regions exhibiting different intrinsic neural timescales. The brain utilizes its own intrinsic neural timescales to actively shape the extrinsic timescales of multiscale inputs it receives from environment and body. Brain criticality is characterized by activity fluctuations that have no preferred timescale.

**Relevance:** Without a preferred timescale, conditional independence can only be evaluated relative to arbitrary temporal resolutions, making blanket identification researcher-dependent rather than ontologically grounded.

## Warrant

Markov blankets require identifying which variables constitute sensory, active, internal, and external states, but these partitions change depending on the timescale of analysis, rendering the blanket itself timescale-relative rather than a stable physical boundary.

## Backing

Conditional independence is defined over probability distributions of variables, but which events count as distinct variable states depends on temporal grain; multiscale dynamics mean no canonical grain exists for brain-environment systems.

The claim of unidirectional sensory transduction is empirically false. Cochlear efferent neurons descend from brainstem olivocochlear nuclei to modulate outer hair cell electromotility by controlling gap junctions in supporting cells, providing negative feedback that regulates hearing sensitivity and protects from noise damage (PMC8759971). Similarly, gamma motor neurons modulate muscle spindle sensitivity. These efferent pathways demonstrate that proposed sensory channels exhibit bidirectional control, with the brain actively adjusting receptor function rather than passively receiving signals.
