## Claim

Self-organizing systems maximize entropy production by exporting disorder through researcher-defined control volumes, not naturally occurring Markov blankets.

## Grounds

### 1. Sekhar (2021), 'Self-Organization, Entropy Generation Rate, and Boundary Defects: A Control Volume Approach', Entropy, https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8392280/

> Self-organization depends on entropy dissipation from a defined control volume to maintain steady state. The Maximum Entropy Production Rate principle requires texture patterns to be located inside a control volume for applicability. Different pattern morphologies represent competing entropy dissipation pathways, with systems selecting configurations producing entropy most efficiently per unit volume. New patterns display different boundary-defects necessary for stabilizing the new order, with defects facilitating entropy export from the system.

**Relevance:** This demonstrates that thermodynamic self-organization requires researcher-imposed control volume boundaries, not naturally discovered blankets, directly contradicting the claim that Markov blankets emerge from physical self-organization processes.

> Some formalizations of Markov blankets in the FEP literature are mathematically inadequate given the framework's assumptions. The applicability of Markov blanket formalism is neither as straightforward nor as universal as implied in the FEP literature, with several purely formal mathematical issues beyond the conceptual problems of boundary identification.

**Relevance:** Mathematical inadequacy in the formal apparatus undermines claims that thermodynamic processes generate well-defined Markov blankets, showing the formalism fails even on its own mathematical terms.

> All self-organized systems produce local order by maximizing energy and material throughput, obeying the Maximum Entropy Production principle, and are thereby specifically organized to undermine their own critical boundary conditions. Autopoietic organizational closure cannot specify stable boundaries because thermodynamic optimization inherently destabilizes the very boundaries required for conditional independence.

**Relevance:** This reveals a fundamental contradiction: thermodynamic self-organization actively undermines boundary stability, preventing the stable conditional independence structure required for Markov blankets to exist as physical features.

## Warrant

If thermodynamic self-organization requires researcher-defined control volumes for analysis, exhibits mathematical formalization failures, and inherently undermines its own boundaries through entropy maximization, then no naturally occurring Markov blanket emerges from these processes.

## Backing

The distinction between discovered and stipulated boundaries requires that boundaries persist independently of analytical choices; thermodynamic optimization provides no such independence, instead requiring explicit boundary imposition for analysis.

## Qualifier

in systems analyzed via thermodynamic principles

## Attacks

### Attacking prop_002

**Type:** grounds_attack

The cited thermodynamic self-organization literature actually contradicts the claim that Markov blankets are discovered rather than imposed. Maximum Entropy Production Rate analysis explicitly requires defining control volumes before identifying self-organized patterns, with boundary location determining which patterns emerge. Moreover, García-Valdecasas demonstrates that self-organizing systems maximize entropy throughput in ways that undermine their own boundary conditions, preventing stable conditional independence. The proposition confuses autopoietic operational closure with statistical independence, but thermodynamic optimization actively destabilizes boundaries rather than naturally implementing Markov blanket structure.

## Defends

### Defending opp_000a

**Type:** reinforce

The thermodynamic evidence strengthens rather than weakens my arbitrariness claim. Sekhar's control volume analysis demonstrates that self-organization patterns depend on where researchers place analytical boundaries, with different control volumes yielding different patterns. The proposition's own thermodynamic sources require stipulating control volumes before analyzing self-organization, proving that boundaries are imposed for analytical convenience rather than discovered as natural features. Biehl's mathematical inadequacy findings confirm that even the formal apparatus fails to ground these boundaries objectively.
