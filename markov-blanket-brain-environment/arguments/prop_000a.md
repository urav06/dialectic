## Claim

The mathematical structure of Markov blankets ensures conditional independence between brain's internal states and environmental external states.

## Grounds

### 1. Kirchhoff et al., Journal of The Royal Society Interface (2018), https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2017.0792

> A Markov blanket establishes that internal states (μ) are conditionally independent from external states (η) given blanket states (b), formally expressed as μ⊥η|b. At the neuronal level, internal states such as ion channel conductances of one neuron are distinguishable from other neurons but interact only through presynaptic membrane potentials (sensory states) and postsynaptic membrane potentials (active states).

**Relevance:** This formal definition proves that sensory and active states constitute a sufficient statistical boundary, rendering brain internals independent of environment when conditioned on these channels.

> Markov blankets scale hierarchically from individual neurons to cortical columns to brain networks. At each level, the blanket comprises sensory states that affect but are not affected by internal states, and active states that affect but are not affected by external states. This recursive structure operationally defines functional units at the chosen descriptive level.

**Relevance:** Hierarchical organization demonstrates that conditional independence holds across multiple scales of neural organization, from synapses to whole-brain systems interacting with environment.

## Warrant

If sensory and active states mediate all causal interactions between internal and external states, then by definition these blanket states screen off internal from external, satisfying the conditional independence criterion that formally defines a Markov blanket.

## Backing

The Markov blanket concept from probability theory requires that a set of variables renders two other sets conditionally independent; the neurophysiological evidence shows sensory/active states exclusively mediate brain-environment coupling.

## Qualifier

at neural scales from synapses to networks
