## Claim

Brain-environment systems operate far from steady state during learning, development, and attention, invalidating Markov blanket conditional independence during essential cognitive functions.

## Grounds

### 1. Baltieri & Isomura (2023), 'Knitting a Markov blanket is hard when you are out-of-equilibrium', https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12914

> Sparse connectivity does not guarantee Markov blankets in steady-state densities of nonequilibrium systems. Testing coupled Lorenz systems and nonequilibrium Ising models reveals that systems further from equilibrium exhibit greater distance from displaying Markov blankets. The results demonstrate that further assumptions beyond sparse coupling are needed to justify Markov blankets in nonequilibrium biological processes.

**Relevance:** This directly contradicts the claim that coupling generates conditional independence, showing distance from equilibrium prevents Markov blanket structure.

### 2. Zenke et al. (2017), 'Hebbian plasticity requires compensatory processes on multiple timescales', https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5247595/

> Hebbian synaptic plasticity underlying learning exhibits positive-feedback instability. LTP induction creates potentiated synapses prone to further potentiation and hyperexcitation, leading to destabilization of network activity. Stabilization requires compensatory rapid heterosynaptic plasticity and activity-dependent processes operating on multiple timescales, revealing learning as fundamentally non-steady-state dynamics.

**Relevance:** Learning operates through unstable positive-feedback dynamics requiring continuous regulation, contradicting the steady-state assumption required for conditional independence.

### 3. Hasenkamp & Barsalou (2012), 'Neural correlates of brain state control', https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3419378/

> Brain state transitions between rest, alertness, and focused attention occur within 100-200 milliseconds, mediated by insula-ACC-striatum networks. Establishing states requires effortful lateral prefrontal engagement while maintaining states involves anterior cingulate activation. These rapid transitions demonstrate continuous switching rather than steady-state operation.

**Relevance:** Cognitive function involves rapid transitions between distinct network configurations, preventing stable steady-state density required for Markov blankets.

## Warrant

If Markov blankets require steady state for conditional independence, but brains operate far from steady state during learning and attention, then no Markov blanket exists during essential cognitive processes.

## Backing

Steady-state density requires converged asymptotic probability distributions, but learning and development involve evolution toward novel configurations incompatible with equilibrium distributions.

## Qualifier

during learning and state transitions

## Attacks

### Attacking prop_001

**Type:** grounds_attack

The cited papers establish conditional independence only at nonequilibrium steady state. However, Baltieri & Isomura demonstrate that distance from equilibrium correlates with distance from displaying Markov blankets. Brain systems during learning operate through positive-feedback Hebbian plasticity requiring continuous stabilization, and attention transitions occur via rapid network reconfigurations. These processes operate far from steady state, rendering the conditional independence claim inapplicable to actual cognitive function during brain-environment interaction.

## Defends

### Defending opp_000b

**Type:** clarify

My argument claimed brain-body-environment tight coupling violates conditional independence—not that coupling prevents independence under all circumstances. The proposition concedes this by restricting conditional independence to steady state. This restriction undermines their position: learning, attention, and development operate far from steady state, meaning no Markov blanket exists when brains perform essential environmental interactions. Mathematical possibility at steady state is irrelevant to biological reality.
