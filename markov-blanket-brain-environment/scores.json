The Hebbian plasticity and attention-switching evidence demonstrates that essential cognitive functions operate far from steady state. The warrant is devastating: if blankets require steady state but cognition requires non-steady dynamics, no blanket exists during actual brain-environment interaction. The defense of opp_000b effectively reframes the earlier coupling argument as vindicated by proposition's steady-state concession.
